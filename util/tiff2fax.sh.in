The file $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache is not present.  This
probably means the machine has not been setup using the faxsetup(@MANNUM1_8@)

# tiffcheck looks over a TIFF document and prints out a string
# that describes what's needed (if anything) to make the file
# suitable for transmission with the specified parameters (page
# width, page length, resolution, encoding).  This string may
# be followed by explanatory messages that can be returned to
# the user.  The possible actions are:
#
# OK		document is ok
# REJECT	something is very wrong (e.g. not valid TIFF)
# REFORMAT	data must be re-encoded
# REVRES	reformat to change vertical resolution
# RESIZE	scale or truncate the pages
# REIMAGE	image is not 1-channel bilevel data
#
# Note that these actions may be combined with "+";
# e.g. REFORMAT+RESIZE.  If we cannnot do the necessary work
# to prepare the document then we reject it here.

    # Two things to be aware of here.  We avoid using hard
    # links because it screws up faxqclean logic that assumes
    # the only hard links are used temporarily when document
    # files are being created during the job submission process.
    # Second, faxq creates the target file and locks it as
    # part of the logic used to insure only one job at a time
    # images a document.  Because we clobber the target file
    # in this case we potentially open a window where someone
    # may decide to image the same document.  We could depend
    # on $LN doing the clobber for us and not remove the file
    # first but on some systems this won't happen even though
    # we are not an interactive process (so there's no way to
    # prompt for a confirmation before clobbering the target).
    # An alternative to all this is to do something like copy
    # $fil to $out but then we would waste disk space.  We'll
    # leave it like this for now and see if problems arise in
    # which case we can always substitute a program that does
    # the right thing.
