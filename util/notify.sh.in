# notify qfile why jobtime [nextTry]
#
# Return mail to the submitter of a job when notification is needed.
#
# This is a rewrite of the notify.sh.
# This version uses the "template" capabilityes to send the e-mails.
# FaxQueuer only calls notify if the job requested notification,
# So if we are called, we *will* send an email (barring any errors)
#
# etc/FaxNotify controls *what* we e-mail
# - TEMPLATE=subdir
# - RETURNFILETYPE=raw|PDF|PS|TIFF
#
# It send the e-mail to $mailaddr, which is the mailaddr of the job.
# The e-mail template used is selectec from:
#   - etc/templates/$TEMPLATE/notify-$WHY-page.txt (only for pager jobs)
#   - etc/templates/$TEMPLATE/notify-$WHY.txt
# If it is a pager job, and notify-$WHY-page.txt does *not* exist, it
# will use the notify-$WHY.txt template.
#
# It honours the RETURNFILETYPE variable that can be set by FaxNotify.
# If it is set, it will return *all* the submitted documents as attachments
# with the e-mail, converted to the RETURNFILETYPE.
# Multiple file types may be specified by separating them with
# whitespace; in that case a separate attachment for each filetype
# will be created.
