HylaFAX 4.4-CVS

Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HylaFAX 4.4 introduces several new features for HylaFAX:

* New scheduler core, optimized for batching and large queues
* Improved faxmail, handling documents independently using the same
  flexible HylaFAX typerules framework used by sendfax
* Improved JPEG/JBIG support for Class1 and Class2
* faxq AuditHook for hooking into all faxq events
* STATUSCODE job paramater to complement the STATE and STATUS parameters
  to allow clients to give customized descriptive messages about the
  status of a job.


Upgrade to 4.4 from Previous releases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to watch:
* rerun faxaddmodem - lots of protocol fixes and corresponding config
  option changes
* rerun faxsetup - changes to the encode selection and use for the
  faxrcvd/notify/pollrcvd scripts
