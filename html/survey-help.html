<HR SIZE=4>

This is the help file for the <A HREF=survey.html>HylaFAX User Survey Form</A>.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="FullName">Full Name</A></H2>

Your given name (as opposed to your login account name).
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="Affiliation">Affiliation</A></H2>

If you work for a company or institution, the name of that
institution.  Otherwise, whatever should be used for correspondence
by postal mail.  For example,

<LI>FooBar Consulting
</UL>
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="Email">E-mail address</A></H2>

is a UUCP mail address and you do not use a service provider
that reliably forwards your mail, please be certain to give an
explicit path relative to a well-known Internet location.
<P>

<A NAME="PostAddress"><HR><H2>Postal address</H2></A>

The postal address where physical mail should be delivered.

(not really, but you get the idea).
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="HostHardware">Host Hardware</A></H2>

The type of machine that HylaFAX is being run on.
Note that some systems have been collected together under generic
labels.  In particular, Sun and PC-style systems are identified by the
hardware CPU.
If you are uncertain what CPU your machine has, look at the output
of the <TT>uname -m</TT> command.
If you do not recognize your machine in the bullet list then
select the <I>other</I> category and give a concise
description.
If you select <I>other</I> it is also important to fill in the
field that shows the output of running <TT>uname -a</TT>.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="Uname">Output of "uname -a"</A></H2>

The <TT>uname</TT> command displays various information about your
machine and operating system.  Many UNIX systems support this command.
If your system has it, include the output from running the command
with the <TT>-a</TT> option; it should look something like:
<PRE>
    IRIX oxford 5.2 02282013 IP12 mips
</PRE>
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="PortDevice">UNIX device name</A></H2>

Give the full pathname of the character special device file that
you configure HylaFAX to use for the modem.
For most systems these files
are located in the <B>/dev</B> directory.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="PortHardware">Serial port hardware</A></H2>

The serial port hardware to which the modem is attached.
If the modem is an <I>internal modem</I>, then you do not need to
fill in this field.
If your serial port hardware is integral to the CPU board, then
select the <I>On-board UART</I> category.
Some of the categories listed for this field combine several items
together: for example, AST-<I>n</I> is used for any of
AST-2, AST-4, and AST-8 (these are different
versions of the same serial port hardware card; they differ
only in the number of serial ports that are supported.)
The <I>generic</I> category is for those (usually PC-based)
"no-name serial I/O cards" that either have separate 16550 UARTs
or use one of the multi-use combination parts (they typically
say something like "serial, parallel, and game port").
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="Vendor">Modem vendor identification</A></H2>

Fill in the vendor's name.  Please use the full name of the vendor
rather than an abbreviation or colloquial name.
For example, you would fill in "US Robotics" or "U.S. Robotics"
instead of the abbreviation "USR".
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="Model">Modem model identification</A></H2>

Fill in the vendor's name for the modem.  This should be
the name you would supply to the vendor if you wanted to
buy another one of the same modem.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="ATFMDL">Result of AT+FMDL? or similar</A></H2>

This is the modem model identification string as returned by the
modem.  For Class 2 modems this is the result of the <TT>AT+FMDL?</TT>
query command.  For Class 2.0 modems this is the result of the
<TT>AT+FMM?</TT> command.  For Class 1 modems there is no single command
to use to find out this information; however one of the <TT>ATI<I>n</I></TT>
commands may return the appropriate information.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="ATFMFR">Result of AT+FMFR? or similar</A></H2>

This is the modem manufacturer identification string as returned by the
modem.  For Class 2 modems this is the result of the <TT>AT+FMFR?</TT>
query command.  For Class 2.0 modems this is the result of the
<TT>AT+FMI?</TT> command.  For Class 1 modems there is no single command
to use to find out this information; however one of the <TT>ATI<I>n</I></TT>
commands may return the appropriate information.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="ATFREV">Result of AT+FREV? or similar</A></H2>

This is the modem firmware revision identification string as returned by the
modem.  For Class 2 modems this is the result of the <TT>AT+FREV?</TT>
query command.  For Class 2.0 modems this is the result of the
<TT>AT+FMR?</TT> command.  For Class 1 modems there is no single command
to use to find out this information; however one of the <TT>ATI<I>n</I></TT>
commands may return the appropriate information.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="FlowControl">Host-modem flow control method</A></H2>

Identify the type of flow control used for communication between
the host and the modem.  Note that this is not necessarily the
same scheme that is used between two modems during a connection.
RTS/CTS is the terminology used to refer to
<I>hardware handshaking</I> or <I>hardware flow control</I>.
XON/XOFF is the terminology used for
<I>software flow control</I>.
For many modems the flow control scheme is set with the <TT>AT&K</TT>
command.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="DCDHandling">DCD handling</A></H2>

Identify how the modem is configured to handle the
Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal.  For many modems this is the
setting set with the <TT>AT&C</TT> command.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="DTRHandling">DTR handling</A></H2>

Identify how the modem is configured to handle the
Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  For many modems this is the
setting set with the <TT>AT&D</TT> command.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="ModemSettings">Modem settings</A></H2>

Include the modem configuration and S-register settings that you use.
Many modems display these settings using the <TT>AT&V</TT> command.
For example, the output from <TT>AT&V</TT> for a ZyXEL 1496E modem is:

<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="ModemUsage">Modem Use</A></H2>

Select all those categories that make sense.  Voice refers to
the use of <I>digitized voice</I> as opposed to normal telephony
usage.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="DataPrograms">Modem Data Use</A></H2>

Select all the programs that you use for sending and receiving data.
The <I>login</I> category should be selected if you accept incoming
login sessions on your modem (necessary for inbound UUCP, SLIP, and
PPP usage).
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="Version">HylaFAX Version</A></H2>

Indicate that version of the HylaFAX software you are using.
If you are unfamiliar with the exact version you have, consult
<A HREF="version.html">this information</A>
 in the HylaFAX distribution.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="Format">HylaFAX Distribution</A></H2>

Indicate whether you built HylaFAX from the source distribution
or if you are using a pre-built binary distribution for your platform.
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="Where">Where did you get HylaFAX from?</A></H2>

Indicate the method by which you obtained your copy of HylaFAX.
<UL>
<LI>If you obtained the software using public FTP on the Internet,
then identify the host from which it was obtained.
<LI>If you obtained the software from a CD-ROM publication, then
identify the publication.
The IndiZone CD-ROM is distributed by Silicon Graphics to all
SGI customers.
The Developers Toolbox CD-ROM is distributed by Silicon Graphics
only to registered SGI developers.
Otherwise
HylaFAX has also appeared on numerous other public domain or
shareware-style CD-ROM publications; if you are using a copy
distributed in this fashion, select <I>other CD-ROM</I> and
identify the publication.
<LI>
Otherwise, if none of the above categories describe how you obtained
the software, select <I>Other</I> and describe how you obtained a
copy of the software.
</UL>
<P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="HylaFAX">HylaFAX modem configuration file</A></H2>

If your modem required some special setup or changes to the normal
HylaFAX prototype configuration files, then please include a copy
of the file or a description of the relevant changes.  Note that normal
site-specific changes such as setting your phone number or selecting
server-related configuration parameters need not be described.
Please only include information specific to configuring the modem.
