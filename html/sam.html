I've been at Silicon Graphics since 1989 doing various things
under the guise of research.
Prior to coming to SGI I worked at Pixar, Lucasfilm, UC Berkeley, and
a little company called Sytek.
I split my work week between Berkeley and Moutain View in California,
commuting part of that distance by bicycle.
If you want help with something don't send mail to me,
send it to the appropriate mailing list.
If you otherwise need
to reach me your best bet is to send electronic mail to
<A HREF="mailto:sam@engr.sgi.com">sam@engr.sgi.com</A>.
(And yes, this dreadful picture was taken with an IndyCam.)
