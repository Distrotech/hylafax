The system includes a driver for modems that conform to
TIA/EIA-592 draft SP-2388-A of August 30, 1991.
Unfortunately, because this was only a draft, there are many modems
that claim to conform to this document, but which diverge in sometimes
subtle ways.
<P>
The Class 2 driver has been extensively tested with a wide variety
of Class 2 modems.
The software attempts to work around many incompatibilities
and mistakes in modem firmware.
A common problem that requires special attention is that some
modems are
incapable of accepting an <TT>AT+FDIS</TT>
command to set the session parameters
between the time a call is placed and a page is transmitted.
Modems with this sort of problem may
ignore the <TT>AT+FDIS</TT> command which causes incorrect
session parameters being used to interpret the page data (often
resulting in ``squished pages''), or abort the session, returning
a <TT>+FHNG:</TT> status message to the host.
If you encounter this problem
use the <TT>Class2DDISCmd</TT> configuration
parameter to enable workaround support in the fax server; e.g.

<UL><TT>
<PRE>Class2DDISCmd:	AT+FDIS</PRE>
</TT></UL>
