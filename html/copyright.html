Silicon Graphics has seen fit to allow me to give this work away.  It
is free.  There is no support or guarantee of any sort as to its
operations, correctness, or whatever.  If you do anything useful with
all or parts of it you need to honor the
copyright notice enclosed below which
basically says ``<CITE>you can't use my name or Silicon Graphics'
name without our written permission</CITE>''.  
I would however be interested in knowing about any
interesting work with HylaFAX and, hopefully, be acknowledged.
Finally, note that HylaFAX is a trademark of Silicon Graphics, Inc.
