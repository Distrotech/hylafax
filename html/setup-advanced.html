This chapter describes how to configure some of the advanced
features of HylaFAX.  In addition it discusses how many of the
modem-specific configuration parameters work together when sending
and receiving facsimile.
The set of per-modem configuration parameters provides a flexible
mechanism for working around many modem and system limitations.

A <A HREF=ixotap.html>separate chapter</A>
discusses setup and configuration of the
support for transmitting messages to alpha-numeric pager terminals
or GSM mobiles.

<A NAME="LID"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Local Identifier Support</A></H3>

The facsimile communication protocols include messages that identify
the sending and receiving devices using a 20-character string.
The T.30 facsimile protocol
specifies that these strings should use only numbers, the ``+''
symbol, and space.
Many fax machines and modem however are capable of accepting a wide range
of ASCII characters.
By default HylaFAX will use the canonical form of the local phone number
for the local identity when sending or receiving facsimile.
This phone number is specified with the per-modem <TT>FAXNumber</TT>
configuration parameter.
If the <TT>LocalIdentifier</TT> parameter is specified, however, HylaFAX
will use it instead.
Unlike <TT>FAXNumber</TT> which is converted to a canonical form that
conforms to the T.30 specification,
the value of the <TT>LocalIdentifier</TT> can be any ASCII string;
for example,

<UL><TT>
<PRE>LocalIdentifier: "Errno Consulting"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

Beware that not all Class 2 and Class 2.0
fax modems support arbitrary ASCII local identifier
strings.  If you encounter problems verify your modem supports this
functionality by sending the following commands (if it is a Class 2 modem):

<UL><TT>
<PRE><B>AT+FCLASS=2</B>
OK
<B>AT+FLID=?</B>
(20)(32-127)
OK</PRE>
</TT></UL>

The response to the <TT>AT+FLID=?</TT> command should indicate the
range of ASCII characters the modem will accept in a local
identifier string.

<A NAME="DialRules"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Dial String Rules</A></H3>

A dial string specifies how to dial the telephone in order to
reach a destination facsimile machine, or other device.
This string is supplied by a user with each outbound job.
User-supplied dial strings need to be processed in two ways by the
HylaFAX server processes:
to craft a canonical phone number for use in locating the
receiver's capabilities, and
to process into a form suitable for sending to a modem.
In addition client applications may need to process a dial string
to formulate an external form that does not include private information
such as a credit card access code.
Phone number canonicalization and dial string preparation
are done according to 
<I>dial string processing rules</I>
that are located in a file specified in the server configuration file;

<UL><TT>
<PRE>DialStringRules: etc/dialrules</PRE>
</TT></UL>

The generation of an externalized form for a dial string is done by
rules that <EM>optionally</EM> appear in
<TT>DIR_LIBDATA</TT><B>/dialrules</B> on client machines (where
<TT>DIR_LIBDATA</TT> is the pathname setup at the time the software
is configured for compilation).

<P>
Dial string rules are an important part of HylaFAX as they permit
local PTT conventions to be handled entirely on the HylaFAX server
machine (e.g. the need to dial ``1'' before certain numbers but
not others).  Client applications are then free to use a canonical format
for phone numbers that is location independent.  Dial string rules
combined with the <TT>ModemDialCmd</TT> also permit modem-specific
idiosyncrasies such as the syntax for doing a ``flash hook'' to be
handled transparently.
Finally, dial string rules can be used to provide dialing <I>aliases</I>
such as mapping ``a-zA-Z'' to the corresponding numeric codes.

<P>
Consult <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?dialrules">dialrules</A>
for detailed information.

<A NAME="TagLine"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Tagline Support</A></H3>

HylaFAX includes support for <I>tag lines</I>; a line of
text imaged at the top of each outgoing facsimile page.
Tag lines imaging requires the specification of:

<UL>
<LI>a format string,
<LI>the name of a file containing an uncompressed Portable
Compiled Font (PCF) from the X11 Window System, and
<LI>the host bit order.
</UL>

When tag lines are enabled the fax
server will image a line of text across the top of each outgoing facsimile
page using the specified tag line format string and font.
This procedure is done <I>on-the-fly</I>, just like a fax machine does it.
However, because the fax server has lots of information about the outbound
facsimile job, the imaged tag line may be setup to display a
variety of information.

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="icons/info_icon.gif" HSPACE=8></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top><CITE>
A 100 dpi 18point Lucida Typewriter font from
the X Window System is included in the HylaFAX distribution
for use in imaging tag lines.
Experiments indicate this is a reasonable font to use.
You can however use an alternate font of your liking.
</CITE></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
On Silicon Graphics systems
a tag line font can be installed by converting one of the compressed font
files provided with the standard X server; e.g.

<UL><LISTING>
% <B>zcat /usr/lib/X11/fonts/lutRS18.pcf.Z &gt; /var/spool/hylafax/etc/lutRS18.pcf</B>
</LISTING></UL>

<P>
To enable use of the font and imaging of the tag lines setup the
<TT>TagLineFont</TT> configuration parameter:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>TagLineFont: etc/lutRS18.pcf</PRE>
</TT></UL>

If font files are stored on your system in an uncompressed format then
you can reference the file directly using an absolute pathname.
Relative pathnames must be specified with respect to the top of the
spooling area.
If the <TT>TagLineFont</TT> parameter references a non-existent file
or a file that does not contain a valid PCF font then tag line support
will be disabled and a message will be logged through syslog.

<P>
The default tag line format string is ``<TT>From %%n|%c|Page %%p of %%t</TT>''
which prints three fields containing the phone number of the server,
the date and time of the outgoing job, and the page number and total pages
for the job.  Consult the <TT>TagLineFormat</TT> parameter description in
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?hylafax-config">config</A>
for information on configuring a different format string.

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="icons/info_icon.gif" HSPACE=8></TD>
<TD>
The
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?tagtest">tagtest</A>
program may be used to try out different tag
line formats and fonts before they are configured for use by the
server.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Finally, be certain the host bit order is configured to reflect the
order of bits on your machine.  The host bit order should be properly
setup at the time the configure script is run. 
If the server has the wrong host
bit order then tag lines will be imaged incorrectly.

<A NAME="AdaptiveAnswer"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Adaptive Answer Support</A></H3>

<I>Adaptive answer</I> is the ability for a modem to determine
whether an incoming phone call is for data, fax, or voice use.
If a modem supports a good adaptive-answering facility
then it should be enabled with the <TT>ModemSetupAACmd</TT>
and HylaFAX will service fax, data, or voice
calls <EM>as identified by the modem</EM> and specified
in the modem configuration files.  For example,

<UL><TT>
<PRE>ModemSetupAACmd: AT+FAA=1</PRE>
</TT></UL>

Beware however that for some modems adaptive-answer support
works properly only when the modem is left in Class 2 or Class 2.0;
this may be a problem if you want to configure the modem to
``idle in Class 0'' to avoid confusing naive programs that
make use of the modem for outbound calls.

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" HSPACE=8></TD>
<TD><EM>The adaptive-answer algorithm used by some modems can confuse
some fax machines and/or data modems.
If you do not intend to service both data and fax calls you may
not want to configure adpative-answer for inbound calls.</EM>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
If a modem does not support adaptive-answering,
then there are several options. 
If the modem is a Class 1 modem,
then HylaFAX provides a simple adaptive-answering
strategy whereby incoming calls are first answered as if they are for a
fax machine and, if that fails, then answered as if they are for a data
modem.  This facility is enabled by specifying something like:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>AdaptiveAnswer:		yes		# enable adaptive answer
AnswerRotary:		"fax data"	# answer for fax, then data
ModemAnswerCmd:		AT+FCLASS=1;A	# default is to answer as fax
ModemAnswerDataCmd:	ATH+FCLASS=0;A	# hangup and answer as data
Class1RecvIdentTimer:	10000		# timeout fax answer in 10 secs</PRE>
</TT></UL>

in the configuration file.   The above lines cause the fax server to do
the following in response to an incoming phone call:

<OL>
<LI>Issue "<TT>AT+FCLASS=1;A</TT>" to answer the phone call in Class 1;
i.e. as a fax machine (issuing CNG tones).
<LI>Send TSI and DIS frames as required by the fax protocol.
<LI>Wait for DCS from the caller (if it is a fax machine).
<LI>Timeout waiting for DCS in 10 seconds (or whatever is specified
for <TT>Class1RecvIdentTimer</TT>).
<LI>Issue "<TT>ATH+FCLASS=0;A</TT>" to hangup and then re-answer the phone
in Class 0; i.e. as a data modem.
</OL>

This technique assumes many things about the capabilities of the modem
and the local telephony service and may not work for all Class 1 modems
or for all locales.

<P>
Note also that by reversing the order of the items specified in the
<TT>AnswerRotary</TT> parameter you can get HylaFAX to answer first
for data and then for fax.  If calls are answered first as data,
then you may need
to constrain the timeout used to recognize a data call so that time
still remains to setup a fax connection.  Consult your modem manual and
the <TT>ModemAnswerResponseTimeout</TT>
configuration parameter.

<P>
A second facility supported by the fax server in lieu of adaptive
answering is a <I>rotary of answering techniques</I>.  The general idea is
that a list of alternative ways to answer the phone is supplied and the
server will rotate through the list on
<EM>consecutive inbound calls</EM>
until it finds one that works.  For example, one might specify something like:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>AnswerRotary: "fax data"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

which would instruct the server to answer incoming calls as if they
were from a fax machine until a call was received from a data modem,
in which case it would then answer subsequent calls
as a data modem until a non-data call was received (in which case it
would go back to fax).  The rotary list can have up to three items,
with items being selected from one of:
<I>fax</I>,
<I>data</I>,
<I>voice</I>,
<I>extern</I>,
and
<I>any</I>
(answer a call of an unknown type).
The
<I>extern</I>
answering request forces an external application (the ``egetty'' program)
to be invoked to
deduce the type of an inbound call (and possibly handle it).
The
<I>voice</I>
answering request causes a ``vgetty'' program to be invoked to handle
the call.
Finally, in conjunction with the
rotary answer facility there is an
<TT>AnswerBias</TT>
parameter that can be
used to specify an index into the rotary list to use after
<EM>successfull</EM> calls.  In the above example, this parameter can be used,
to force calls to always be answered first as data by specifying:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>AnswerRotary:	"fax data"
AnswerBias:  	1</PRE>
</TT></UL>

Note that the adaptive-answer and rotary answer facilities differ only
in whether the rotary of answering techniques is applied to a single
call or to consecutive calls.

<A NAME="CallerID"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Caller-ID Support</A></H3>

Caller-ID is a feature provided by phone companies
whereby information about a calling party is passed
to the receiver <EM>prior</EM> to answering a call.
This facility is not universally available and not all modems
are capable of processing the provided signals.
For modems that are capable of processing caller-ID information
HylaFAX provides the following support.

<UL>
<LI>Any caller-ID information received by a faxgetty process
    is recorded in trace logs provided the <TT>ServerTracing</TT>
    configuration parameter is set to enable the collection
    of server messages.
<LI>Inbound calls may be accepted or rejected according to an
    access control list specified by the <TT>QualifyCID</TT>
    configuration parameter.
</UL>

Note that HylaFAX parses caller-ID information according to two
configuration parameters, <TT>CIDName</TT> and <TT>CIDNumber</TT>,
that specify how to identify a caller's
name and phone number (if provided by the modem).
For example, for a ZyXEL U1496 modem, the appropriate
configuration parameters to use for caller-ID are:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>CIDNumber: "CALLER NUMBER: " # pattern string for phone number info
CIDName:   "CALLER NAME: "   # pattern string for identity info</PRE>
</TT></UL>

Consult
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?hylafax-config">config</A>
for a full description of the caller-ID-related configuration
parameters.

<A NAME="DistinctiveRing"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Distinctive Ring Support</A></H3>

Distinctive ring is a feature provided by phone companies
whereby multiple phone numbers can be directed to a single
phone line with different ring patterns for each phone number.
This is a simple mechanism that can be used to
distinguish between incoming
fax, voice, and data calls (i.e. all fax calls are directed
to one number, voice to a different number, and data to a
different number).

<P>
HylaFAX supports distinctive ring capabilities through the
<TT>RingFax</TT>, <TT>RingData</TT>, and <TT>RingVoice</TT> modem
configuration parameters.
Modems that support distinctive ring send a different <TT>RING</TT>
status message to the host depending on the ring pattern presented
by the phone company.
By setting the configuration parameters faxgetty will match the
appropriate <TT>RING</TT> status message and use the information
to treat the inbound call as fax, data, or voice <EM>before</EM> answering
the call.  For example,

<UL><TT>
<PRE>RingFax:	RING1		# treat ring pattern 1 as fax
RingData:	RING2		# treat ring pattern 2 as data</PRE>
</TT></UL>

<A NAME="CopyQuality"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Copy Quality Checking</A></H3>

HylaFAX will automatically check
the quality of received facsimile and regenerate rows of data that have
errors in them.  This facility is termed <I>copy quality checking</I>
and is only done if the modem is incapable of doing this task itself, or if
the software is configured so that modem copy quality checking is
disabled.  

<P>
Copy quality checking is automatically done in the server
for Class 1 modems.
To configure copy quality checking directly
in a Class 2 or Class 2.0 modem--when the modem is
capable--setup the <TT>Class2CQCmd</TT> parameter for the
modem.  For example,

<UL><TT>
<PRE>Class2CQCmd: "AT+FCQ=1;+FBADMUL=5;+FBADLIN=10"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

This enables copy quality checking for receiving and sets the copy
quality parameters so that acceptable page quality requires that no
more than 10 consecutive bad rows of data may be present and less than
5% of the rows in a page have errors in them.
To disable copy quality checking in the modem use

<UL><TT>
<PRE>Class2CQCmd: AT+FCQ=0</PRE>
</TT></UL>

If a modem indicates that it supports copy quality checking but
<TT>Class2CQCmd</TT> has not been specified then HylaFAX will note
this when the modem is prepared for use.

<P>
Copy quality checking in the server (for any style of modem)
is controlled by two configuration parameters:
<TT>PercentGoodLines</TT> and
<TT>MaxConsecutiveBadLines</TT>;
see
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?hylafax-config">config</A>
for more information.  These parameters define the
criteria by which the server decides if a received page has acceptable
copy quality.  Pages that are deemed unacceptable are rejected and the
sender is told to resend the page.

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10>
<EM>Beware that many fax machines
are incapable of resending pages that have unacceptable copy quality
because they do not buffer a full page image.</EM>

<P>
If you encounter problems with the copy quality checking support you
can disable it by setting either the
<TT>PercentGoodLines</TT> or
<TT>MaxConsecutiveBadLines</TT>
parameters to 0; e.g.

<UL><TT>
<PRE>PercentGoodLines:	0	# disable copy quality checking</PRE>
</TT></UL>

Note however that doing this means you may receive facsimile that are
unreadable.

<A NAME="ContCoverPages"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Continuation Cover Pages</A></H3>

A <I>continuation cover page</I> is a cover page automatically generated
by HylaFAX when retransmitting an outbound job after a protocol
error abnormally terminated a previous transmission.
This cover page is only generated when a user-submitted cover page has
already been transmitted; it is intended to identify the sending
system and provide information about why the retransmit is being done.
HylaFAX generates the cover page using the parameters supplied when the
job was submitted.
In addition it provides a <I>comments</I> section that identifies
the transmission as a continuation of a previous job and describes
why the previous attempt to transmit failed (this may be useful
to the receiver).

<P>
By default HylaFAX does not enable continuation cover pages.
To enable use of this feature the <TT>ContCoverPage</TT> configuration
parameter must be set to the pathname of a cover sheet template
file to use in generating continuation cover pages.
This cover page template file is passed to the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?mkcover">mkcover</A>
script, or to the program specified with the <TT>ContCoverCmd</TT>
configuration parameter; consult the mkcover manual page
for a description of this file.

<A NAME="TimeOfDay"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Time-of-Day Usage Scheduling</A></H3>

HylaFAX can be configured so that outbound calls are placed only
during certain hours of the day.
This can optionally be configured on a
<A HREF="#DestControls">per-destination basis</A>, making it easy
to reduce phone costs by processing toll calls only during the
time when off-peak rates are available.

<P>
By default outbound calls are permitted at any time.
To constrain calls to a particular time or range of times the
<TT>TimeOfDay</TT> parameter can be setup according to the syntax
specified in
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?hylafax-config">config</A>.
This syntax is consistent with the syntax used by the UUCP software.
For example, to permit outbound calls only between 9AM and 5PM
local time the following might be used:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>TimeOfDay:	"0900-1700"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

<A NAME="DestControls"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Per-destination Controls</A></H3>

HylaFAX supports many controls on the operation of the scheduler
and related software.
For example, outbound jobs may be restricted so that processing is
only done at certain times of the day.
All of these parameters can be specified in the configuration
file used by the central HylaFAX scheduler process.
Parameters specified in this way apply to <EM>all outbound jobs</EM>.
It is also possible to specify these parameters on a
<EM>per-destination basis</EM> using the <TT>DestControls</TT>
configuration parameter.
This parameter specifies the pathname of a file that holds
per-destination control parameters;
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?destctrls">destctrls</A>.

<P>
Per-destination controls are especially useful for controlling
which phone numbers can be called.  For example, by specifying
an entry of the form:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>^911$	RejectNotice = "Calls to emergency numbers are not permitted"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

any outbound job that would cause HylaFAX to phone 911 would automatically
be rejected with the submitter notified by electronic mail using the
specified message.

<P>
Another useful feature of this facility is the ability to delay toll
calls to off-hours so that off-peak phone rates may be used.  Entries
of the form:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>^[+]1415.*	TimeOfDay = "Any"
^[+]1510.*	TimeOfDay = "Any"
.*		TimeOfDay = "Wk1700-0830,Sat,Sun"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

might be used to permit calls to US area codes 415 and 510 at any
time of day, but force all other calls to be done only during off hours.

Note that the parameters specified in the configuration
file serve as the <EM>default values</EM> to use when
scheduling an outbound job.  That is, if a parameter value
is not obtained from the destination controls file then it
is taken from any parameters specified in the configuration file.
For example, if the above rules had not included the last
line that matched ``<TT>.*</TT>'', then the time-of-day to use
for long-distance calls would have been that specified in the
configuration file (by default <TT>Any</TT>).

<A NAME="PageChopping"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Automatic Truncation of Whitespace</A></H3>

HylaFAX can be configured to automatically discard trailing whitespace in
outbound facsimile.
This truncation is termed <I>page chopping</I> and can be setup so that it
is done for every page, only the last page of each document, or not all.
Page chopping is performed during document preparation and is applied to
all submitted documents, no matter what format they are submitted in.
By default HylaFAX will only chop the last page of a document and at
least 3 inches of trailing whitespace must be present before the page
will be truncated.
The <TT>PageChop</TT> and <TT>PageChopThreshold</TT> configuration
parameters control the page chopping support.
Clients can override the defaults setup on the server for each outbound
job through command line options to sendfax and client-side configuration
parameters.

<A NAME="ModemGroup"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Modem Groups</A></H3>

Groups of modems can be referenced by name using a facility termed
<I>modem groups</I>.
A modem group defines a logical name for a set of modem devices on a
server.  This name can be used by clients in the same way that a
specific modem device is used.
The default modem to use for outbound jobs, ``any'', is actually just
a predefined modem group.
Modem groups are useful for groups that want to logically partition
a set of modems on a single server.

<P>
Modem groups are defined with the <TT>ModemGroup</TT> configuration
parameter.
Each definition specifies a name and a regular expression that identifies
the set of modems that are to be included in the class.
For example,

<UL><TT>
<PRE>ModemGroup:	"any:.*"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

is the builtin definition for ``any''.  Regular expressions are matched
against device identifiers for modems that are signalled to faxq by
faxmodem or faxgetty.

<A NAME="ModemPriority"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Modem Priorities</A></H3>

The HylaFAX scheduler process assigns modems to outbound jobs based
on three criteria:
the modem is considered ready for use,
the modem is a member of the requested modem group (if any was specified), and
the modem's capabilities support the requirements of the job (e.g.
transmission of high-resolution 2D-encoded data).
When multiple modems are present on a server machine it is also
possible to force an <I>order</I> to the set of modems that are
considered for allocation by assigning each modem a <I>priority</I>.
This can be used, for example, to reduce the likelihood of assigning
modems that are heavily used for inbound calls; e.g. near the front
of a hunt group.

<P>
Modem priorities are specified using the <TT>ModemPriority</TT>
configuration parameter.
Priority values are integer numbers in the range 0-255 with lower
values meaning higher priority.

<P>
Modem priorities are passed to the HylaFAX scheduler by the
faxgetty processes or with the faxmodem program.
Priorities can be dynamically changed by using the faxconfig
program to send a new priority to a faxgetty process (who in
turn will notify the scheduler), e.g.

<UL><LISTING>
hyla# <B>faxconfig -m ttyf2 ModemPriority 32</B>
</LISTING></UL>

or with the <TT>-u</TT> option to the faxmodem program
when operating in a send-only environment.
The ability to dynamically alter the priority of modems means
it is easy to reconfigure modem usage based on time-of-day and
traffic patterns.

<A NAME="Transcoding"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Transcoding of Received Facsimile</A></H3>

<I>Transcoding</I> refers to the on-the-fly conversion of encoded data.
HylaFAX supports transcoding of received facsimile so that received
documents can be stored in files using an optimal compression algorithm.
If the <TT>RecvDataFormat</TT> configuration parameter is set it defines
the format for writing received facsimile data, one of: ``1-D MH'', ``2-D MR'',
``2-D MMR'', or ``adaptive''.
An ``adaptive'' format is the default; it causes the received data to be
written using the data format negotiated by the sender and receiver.
Using

<UL><TT>
<PRE>RecvDataFormat: "2-D MMR"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

gives the most space-efficient data format.
Note that <TT>RecvDataFormat</TT> defines the encoding of the page data,
not the file format: this is always TIFF.


<A NAME="FaxRcvd"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Automatic Processing of Received Facsimile</A></H3>

It is desirable to deliver inbound facsimile directly to
receipients.  HylaFAX routes inbound facsimile through the
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?faxrcvd">faxrcvd</A> shell script.
This script may be tailored to use local knowledge and/or tools to
route and deliver inbound facsimile.
In particular, if facsimile are received from well-known senders 
and always directed to a specific person faxrcvd can be tailored
to automatically dispatch these facsimile by electronic mail;
consult the manual page for details.
Services such as Direct Inward Dial (DID) are not
supported because the hardware uses non-standard programming interfaces.
In the future, when updated versions of the ITU facsimile
protocols are supported in commercial fax modems HylaFAX will
be able to use routing information provided in the protocol
to do automatic delivery of inbound facsimile.

<P>
Another common request is to automatically print received facsimile
as they arrive.
This is easy to do by editing the faxrcvd script to use a program
such as fax2ps or tiff2ps to convert the TIFF/F file
and then submit the resulting PostScript; e.g.

<UL><LISTING>
$TIFFBIN/fax2ps $1 | lp
</LISTING></UL>

Note that <TT>TIFFBIN</TT> is known to be the pathname of the
directory where the TIFF tools have been installed (see faxsetup
and the file <B>etc/setup.cache</B> in the spooling area).

<A NAME="QualifyTSI"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Rejecting Junk Facsimile</A></H3>

By default HylaFAX will accept inbound facsimile from any caller.
If the <TT>QualifyTSI</TT> configuration parameter is setup then
HylaFAX will receive inbound facsimile only if the caller sends
an acceptable Transmitting Subscriber Identification (TSI) string;
a string that uniquely identifies who the sender is.
HylaFAX determines which TSI are acceptable by using the rules
given in the file specified with <TT>QualifyTSI</TT>.
This mechanism provides a way to automatically reject
<I>junk facsimile</I>.
Note however that because a TSI is not authenticated in any
way it is a simple matter for a caller to masquerade as an
acceptable sender and bypass the access control mechanism.
Consult <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?tsi">tsi</A>
for complete details of this facility.

<A NAME="LockFiles"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>UUCP Lock Files</A></H3>

HylaFAX implements shared inbound/outbound modem usage using UUCP
lock files.
In normal operation each modem has a faxgetty process listening
for data from the modem.
When an inbound call is received the modem emits a <TT>RING</TT>
status message that wakes up the appropriate faxgetty process.
faxgetty then checks the UUCP lock file for the port to make sure
the port is not busy for outbound use.
If the port is busy (i.e. a UUCP lock file is present), then faxgetty
will stop listening on the port and wait for the outbound use to
terminate.
If the port is not busy, then faxgetty will answer the call according
to the parameters specified in the configuration file.

<P>
For this scheme to work outbound callers must install a UUCP
lock file before using a modem.
This lock file must be created using the same conventions understood
by HylaFAX.
In particular the lock file name must be consistent and the
file contents must include the process ID of the lock file owner
written either as a binary or ascii value according to the
system-specific conventions.

<P>
HylaFAX supports several schemes found on different systems.
The appropriate scheme is normally setup according to the target
system at the time that HylaFAX is configured for building.
It is possible, however, to override these parameters through
the runtime configuration files; consult the 
<A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?hylafax-config">config</A>
manual page for information about the <TT>UUCPLockType</TT>
configuration parameter.
In addition to the lock type there are configuration parameters
that control the protection mode of the lock file (<TT>UUCPLockMode</TT>),
the directory in which lock files are created (<TT>UUCPLockDir</TT>),
and a timeout parameter used to purge <I>stale lock files</I>.
Again, consult <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?hylafax-config">config</A> for
a full description of these parameters.

<A NAME="Class2Liars"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Modems that Lie about their Capabilities</A></H3>

Class 2 and 2.0 fax modems all too frequently have bugs in their firmware.
Sometimes it is possible to workaround firmware problems by restricting
a modems' capabilities.
To do this the <TT>Class2DCCQueryCmd</TT> configuration parameter may
be set in the per-modem configuration file.
By default this parameter holds the command to send the modem to
query its capabilities.
However if the query string has a leading ``!'' then no command is
sent to the modem and instead the remainder of the string is
treated as the response returned by the modem.
Thus to avoid using a particular modem capability all you need to
do is setup a capabilities string that has a restricted set of
modem capabilities.

<P>
Capabilities are returned using a syntax specified in the Class 2/2.0
specification:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>(vr),(br),(wd),(ln),(df),(ec),(bf),(st)</PRE>
</TT></PRE></UL>

where,

<UL><DL COMPACT>
<DT><TT>vr</TT>
<DD>indicates which vertical resolutions are supported,
<DT><TT>br</TT>
<DD>indicates which signaling rates are supported,
<DT><TT>wd</TT>
<DD>indicates which page widths are supported,
<DT><TT>ln</TT>
<DD>indicates which page lengths are supported,
<DT><TT>df</TT>
<DD>indicates which data formats are supported,
<DT><TT>ec</TT>
<DD>indicates whether or not the optional Error Correction Mode (ECM) is supported,
<DT><TT>bf</TT>
<DD>indicates whether or not the optional Binary File Transfer (BFT) protocol
is supported, and
<DT><TT>st</TT>
<DD>indicates which minimum scan times are supported.
</DL></UL>

Each parameter is specified as single value,
range of values (e.g. <TT>0-3</TT>),
or list of values (e.g. <TT>0,1,2</TT>).
The values are given in the Class 2/2.0 specification and in the following

<P>
An example use of this mechanism is found in the prototype
configuration file for the AT&T DataPort modem.
The rev C01.66.10 firmware for the DataPort returns an invalid
string for the <TT>AT+FDCC=?</TT> query command so the prototype
configuration file supplies a valid one instead:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>Class2DCCQueryCmd:      "!(0,1),(0-5),(0-4),(0-2),(0),(0),(0),(0-7)"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

Beware of specifying that a modem has capabilities that it
does not; HylaFAX is likely to try and make use of them!

<A NAME="ModemSetup"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Configuration Parameter Usage During Modem Setup</A></H3>

There are many configuration parameters that control the operation of HylaFAX
in resetting and initializing a modem.
This section presents these parameters and explains how
they fit together in normal operation.
By understanding how these parameters are used it is possible to control
many aspects of the operation of HylaFAX.

<P>
In normal operation HylaFAX will first <I>reset</I> a modem and
then prepare it for use with a setup procedure appropriate for the
modem.  Modem reset involves the following steps:

<OL>
<LI>Lower the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal, pause <TT>ModemResetDelay</TT>
    milliseconds, and then raise DTR.  DTR is used to force a modem reset
    rather than sending a command such as <TT>ATZ</TT> to the modem because
    many modems can get confused and enter a state where commands sent 
    from the host are ignored.  Instead HylaFAX uses a hardware control
    signal to force the modem to do a reset operation.  This usage requires
    that a modem respond to a DTR transition by resetting itself.
    Since modems all take different amounts of time to do a reset operation
    the time that HylaFAX waits for the modem to complete the reset
    operation is programmable.
    A certain Hayes Technical bulletin claims one should wait 2.6 seconds
    for a modem to complete a reset operation.
    In practice this is much longer than most modems need and this
    parameter can be reduced with a significant speedup in the overall
    setup process.
<LI>Once the modem has been reset (assuming the modem monitors DTR and
    does the ``right thing'' in response to DTR being lowered), HylaFAX
    sets up the baud rate and flow control parameters for the tty device
    using the <TT>ModemRate</TT> and <TT>ModemFlowControl</TT> parameters.
<LI>HylaFAX then flushes any data received from the modem since the reset
    and sends the following sequence of commands:

<PRE>
<TT>ModemResetCmds</TT>		any additional reset commands
<TT>ModemEchoOffCmd</TT>		disable modem echo of commands
<TT>ModemVerboseResultsCmd</TT>	enable verbose result codes
<TT>ModemResultCodesCmd</TT>	enable transmission of result codes
<TT>ModemNoAutoAnswerCmd</TT>	disable modem from auto-answering calls
<TT>ModemOnHookCmd</TT>		place modem ``on hook''
<TT>ModemPauseTimeCmd</TT>	configure delay for "," in dial string
<TT>ModemWaitTimeCmd</TT>	configure time to wait for carrier
<TT><I>modemflowcontrolcmd</I></TT>	establish DTE-DCE flow control scheme
<TT>ModemSetupDTRCmd</TT>	force desired modem response to DTR transition
<TT>ModemSetupDCDCmd</TT>	force desired modem response to DCD transition </PRE>

Note that these commands are sent as two separate <TT>AT</TT>
commands, broken between <TT>ModemOnHookCmd</TT>
and <TT>ModemPauseTimeCmd</TT>;
this is done to avoid problems with certain modems.
</OL>

The reset sequence must be successful
for HylaFAX to consider the modem in an acceptable state
and to proceed with the subsequent steps:

<OL>
<LI>Query the modem using <TT>ModemClassQueryCmd</TT> to verify it
    supports the functionality specified by the <TT>ModemType</TT>
    (this parameter can be used to control which class to use when
    a modem supports multiple classes).
<LI>Set the modem into the appropriate class using <TT>Class<I>X</I>Cmd</TT>,
    where <TT><I>X</I></TT> is one of 0, 1, or 2, depending on the application.
<LI>Identify the manufacturer, model, and firmware revision information
    using <TT>ModemMfrQueryCmd</TT>, <TT>ModemModelQueryCmd</TT>, and
    <TT>ModemRevQueryCmd</TT> parameters.  This information is obtained
    early in the setup procedure in case special-case handling is required
    for the modem.  Note also that for Class 1 modems it is typically not
    possible to query the modem for some of this information and it must
    instead be ``hard-coded'' in the prototype modem configuration file
    that is selected
    according to the product ID code returned by the <TT>ATI0</TT> command.
<LI>Identify the modem capabilities using the <TT>ModemDCCQueryCmd</TT>
    for Class 2/2.0 modems, or according to the capabilities of the
    Class 1 driver and the result of <TT>AT+FTM=?</TT> and <TT>AT+FRM=?</TT>
    commands for Class 1 modems.
<LI>For Class 2/2.0 modems: establish whether the modem supports copy-quality
    checking and polled retrieval of documents; both these capabilities are
    automatically provided by the driver for Class 1 modems.  If the modem
    supports copy quality checking, according to the result of the
    <TT>Class2CQQueryCmd</TT> and copy-quality setup commands are provided
    with the <TT>Class2CQCmd</TT> parameter, then the modem is setup accordingly.
</OL>

Modem initialization is then carried out by sending the following commands
to the modem:

Flow control is explicitly set separately for Class 0 (data) operation
and Class 1, 2, 2.0 (fax) operation.  To configure the use of a
different flow control scheme in each class simply override the
default definition of the <TT>Class</TT><I>X</I><TT>Cmd</TT> parameter; e.g.

<UL><TT>
<PRE>Class2Cmd: "AT+FCLASS=2&lt;xon&gt;"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

Note however that this will only work for outbound usage; doing
something similar for inbound processing is more complicated because
the modem, rather than the host, decides when to switch between Class 0 and
Class 1, 2, 2.0.  Consequently HylaFAX must <EM>react to
events rather than initiate them</EM>.  This work is also complicated
by the fact that many modems do not accept commands (or are confused
by commands) from the host during certain critical sections of
inbound call processing.

<A NAME="Outbound"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Modem Parameter Usage for Outbound Calls</A></H3>

An outbound facsimile job is broken up into <I>phases</I> that
correspond roughly 
to the phases defined in the CCITT T.30 facsimile protocol:

<UL>
<LI>call placement
<LI>selection of station session capabilities
<LI>per-page capabilities negotiation
<LI>page transfer
<LI>page acknowledgement
</UL>

The last three phases may be repeated multiple times depending on the 
number and characteristics of the facsimile being transmitted.

<P>
To send a facsimile a phone call must be placed.  HylaFAX takes the
following actions:

<OL>
<LI>Lock the modem.
<LI>Initialize the modem for outbound facsimile use.
<LI>Instruct the modem to place the phone call.
</OL>

The corresponding set of commands sent to the modem are:

</TABLE>

<P>
Note that the modem is always switched into the appropriate class
and flow control scheme before placing the call.
For Class 2 modems that do not properly implement the <TT>AT+FDIS</TT>
command the <TT>Class2DDISCmd</TT> parameter must be configured so that
HylaFAX will setup initial session parameters <EM>before</EM> placing
the phone call.

<P>
If the call completes and a facsimile transmit session is started then
HylaFAX will send <TT>ModemSendBeginCmd</TT> to the modem.
This parameter can be used to enable servicing that must be done only
while Carrier Detect (CD) is asserted to the host.
For example, on Sun systems it is not possible to enable
RTS/CTS flow control on serial ports implemented with the ZS8530
unless CD is asserted; to workaround this problem for outbound calls
one can use:

<UL><TT>
<PRE>ModemSendBeginCmd:	"&lt;rts&gt;"</PRE>
</TT></UL>

to force HylaFAX to enable RTS/CTS flow control on the host tty device
after carrier is established.  Beware however that some modems raise
and lower CD during Class 1 operation and this can cause problems
for systems with restrictions of this sort.

<P>
The next phase in the processing of an outbound job is the
selection of station capabilities.
The receiver is required to transmit a series of messages that
provide its identity and capabilities (e.g. whether it can accept
2D-encoded facsimile data).
HylaFAX examines the received capabilities and compares them to
the capabilities required for the job.
If the receiver is capable of accepting the documents to be sent
then HylaFAX proceeds with the transmission.
Otherwise HylaFAX will disconnect and, either re-prepare the outbound
documents according to the receiver's capabilities or reject the
job because it cannot be sent.

<P>
Page transfer requires the selection of session capabilities that
correspond to the page to be transferred and the actual transfer
of the page data to the modem.
HylaFAX handles documents with varying page characteristics. 
In particular this means that documents with a mixture of high
res and low res data (e.g. a low res cover page followed by
high res image or text) are handled transparently.

<P>
For Class 2 modems session parameters are set using the
<TT>Class2DISCmd</TT> (note that this is not the same as <TT>Class2DDISCmd</TT>).
If the negotiated session parameter needs to be changed then this
command will be sent to the modem.
The Class 2 specification requires that a modem accept this command
at any time prior to an <TT>AT+FDT</TT> command.
However because some modems do not properly implement this part
of the specification the <TT>Class2DDISCmd</TT> is provided to workaround 
modem limitations.
Beware however that modems that require <TT>Class2DDISCmd</TT> may 
not be capable of renegotiating session parameters at all; this can
be an annoying problem.

<P>
For Class 2/2.0 modems, page data is transferred using the
<TT>AT+FDT</TT> command.
This command instructs the modem that a page of facsimile data
will follow.
The modem is released to negotiate session parameters (as needed)
and HylaFAX then waits for a response that indicates page data
may be transferred to the modem.
Class 2 modems indicate they are ready for page data by sending
<TT>CONNECT</TT> followed by XON (DC1) to the host.
(The <TT>ModemWaitForXON</TT> configuration parameter controls whether
or not HylaFAX should wait for XON because some Class 2 modems
do not follow this aspect of the spec.)
Class 2.0 modems indicate they are ready for page data by sending
a <TT>CONNECT</TT> response to the host (but no XON).
Class 2 modems return <TT>OK</TT> to the host when they have
accepted all the page data.
Class 2.0 modems do not return <TT>OK</TT>.

<P>
After a page of data has been transferred to the modem HylaFAX
indicates whether this is the last page to be sent and/or whether
more documents are to come.
A <I>post-page message</I> is then sent and a post-page response
is awaited.
Class 2/2.0 modems handle this exchange entirely within the modem.
For Class 1 modems HylaFAX implements this part of the protocol
on the host: the post-page message may be retransmitted as many
as three times.
A post-page response indicates whether a page was successfully received
and/or whether or not the receiver wants to resynchronize the
line due to a perceived loss in signal quality.
HylaFAX is capable of retransmitting pages that a receiver deems
unacceptable.
HylaFAX will automatically retransmit a page up to three times
if it does not receive a positive acknowledgement from the receiver.


<A NAME="Inbound"><P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right><H3>Modem Parameter Usage for Inbound Calls</A></H3>

Inbound call handling is the most complicated part of the HylaFAX
software.
This is because modems vary so widely in the way they process inbound
calls for fax, data, and voice use.
Also, inbound calls typically require that a modem be configured
<EM>before</EM> a call is received and many modems do not accept
commands from the host until after a call has been recognized,
accepted, and processing initiated.

<P>
HylaFAX handles inbound calls in the faxgetty program.
The modem is initialized as <A HREF="#ModemSetup">described above</A>
and faxgetty then waits for a ring status message from the modem.
On receiving input from the modem the following processing takes place:

<OL>
<LI>The modem is locked.  If the modem cannot be locked
    because there is an outbound user in control of the modem then
    it is released and faxgetty will wait for the lock file 
    to be removed.
<LI>Wait for <TT>RingsBeforeAnswer</TT> rings, waiting at most 5 seconds
    for each ring status message.
    If distinctive ring support is configured (<TT>RingFax</TT>,
    <TT>RingData</TT>, and <TT>RingVoice</TT>) then the ring status
    messages are checked and the type of call is potentially deduced.
    If Caller-ID support is configured (<TT>CIDName</TT> and
    <TT>CIDNumber</TT>), then any Caller-ID information returned by the
    modem is parsed.
<LI>If the appropriate number of rings was not received, then the
    line is hung up and the modem is reset and initialized.
<LI>Check any Caller-ID information.  If <TT>QualifyCID</TT> is configured
    and the caller is not acceptable, then reset and initialize the modem.
<LI>If the call type is already known from distinctive ring information, then
    the call is processed immediately.  If faxgetty was instructed to answer
    any type of call, then the call is answered as appropriate.
    However, if a particular type of call was to be processed (e.g. data)
    and the deduced type of call does not match, then the call is
    rejected and the modem is reset and initialized.
<LI>If the call type is unknown then the call is answered according
    to the the current type specified by
    <TT>AnswerRotary</TT> and <TT>AnswerRotor</TT>.
<LI>If the call is not successfully answered and if <TT>AdaptiveAnswer</TT>
    is enabled, the next item in the <TT>AnswerRotary</TT> list is used
    to immediately re-answer the call.  This is repeated until a call
    is successfully answered or the list of choices in <TT>AnswerRotary</TT>
    is exhausted.
</OL>

Call answering is done as follows:

<OL>
<LI>Send the modem one of
    <TT>ModemAnswerDataCmd</TT>,
    <TT>ModemAnswerFaxCmd</TT>, and
    <TT>ModemAnswerVoiceCmd</TT> according to whether the call is to
    be answered as data, fax, or voice, respectively.
    If any of these are not set then <TT>ModemAnswerCmd</TT> is used instead.
<LI>Wait for a response from the modem that signifies carrier has
    been established and which identifies the type of call.
    The exact set of responses is given in 
    <A HREF="@CGIPATH@/manpage?hylafax-config">config</A>.
<LI>If <TT>ModemWaitForConnect</TT> is enabled, then HylaFAX will read
    responses from the modem until a <TT>CONNECT</TT> response is sent
    to the host or an error is detected; e.g.

<UL>
<PRE><U><B>Host</B></U>      <U><B>Modem</B></U><TT>
ATA  -->
     <--  DATA
     <--  CONNECT</PRE>
</TT></UL>

<LI>If a call is successfully answered, then one of
    <TT>ModemAnswerDataBeginCmd</TT>,
    <TT>ModemAnswerFaxBeginCmd</TT>, and
    <TT>ModemAnswerVoiceBeginCmd</TT>,
    is sent to the modem according to the call type deduced above.
    This mechanism is useful for modems that automatically change
    DTE-DCE communication to a fixed line speed or flow control setting
    for inbound facsimile calls.
</OL>

At this point the call has been answered, carrier established,
and the call type is known.

<UL>
<LI>Data calls are handled by invoking a system getty program; but
    only if the <TT>GettyArgs</TT> parameter is set.
<LI>Voice calls are handled by invoking a system vgetty program; but
    only if the <TT>VGettyArgs</TT> parameter is set.
<LI>Facsimile calls are handled directly in faxgetty.
</UL>

For a data or voice call faxgetty forks and execs the appropriate
program.  The UUCP lock file is setup so that it is owned by the
child (important for SLIP and PPP) and the parent handles cleanup
of various resources when the child process terminates.

<P>
For fax operation faxgetty drops into the facsimile receive protocol.

<P>
<I>More to be added.</I>
