This software is more than 6 years old and is the product of many
folks' work.  Robin Schaufler did the original scheme for delayed
submission and worked on the original client-server protocol.
More recently,
the following people have helped either by testing or by contributing
fixes and/or improvements:

(and surely others).  Also, a special thanks to Ed McCreight for
helping me understand the stuff <I>between the lines</I>
that's necessary to make a working Class 1 driver.

<EM>The home page artwork was sketched by Rob Myers.
I then butchered it with my handy use of the freely available
<A HREF=http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~gimp>gimp program</A>. 
If you like the art <A HREF=mailto:rob@engr.sgi.com>send Rob a compliment</A>. 
If you don't like it blame me, or better yet,
<A HREF=mailto:sam@engr.sgi.com>send me</A>
a better version to replace it (please).
Please note that the artwork is copyright Silicon Graphics Inc. and
is not to be used without written permission.

The code to read PCF fonts is distantly related to the X11R5 code that is

The
<TT>textfmt</TT>
program is <EM>very distantly</EM>
related to the <TT>lptops</TT> program written
by Nelson Beebe; there was no copyright notice on the version of the code
that <TT>textfmt</TT> grew out of.

The <B>config.guess</B> and <B>config.sub</B>
scripts are part of the GNU autoconf
package and covered by the GNU Public License (GPL).  Several ideas
in the configure script are directly "borrowed" from autoconf (and I
have tried to maintain as much compatibility as possible).

The PCF font <B>etc/lutRS18.pcf</B> included for use with tag lines is a
compiled version of a LucidaTypewriter font that was contributed to X11
by Bigelow & Holmes.  Redistribution of this font requires inclusion of
