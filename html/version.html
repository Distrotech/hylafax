If you have need to refer to this specific software,
you should identify it as:

<UL>
<PRE>HylaFAX v&lt;<I>version</I>&gt;&lt;<I>n</I>&gt;</PRE>
</UL>

where &lt;<I>version</I>&gt; is found in the file <B>VERSION</B>
and &lt;<I>n</I>&gt; is the number recorded in the file
<B>dist/hylfax.alpha</B> of the source distribution.
This string is also prominently displayed when you run the
configure script to setup the software for compilation and each
time the faxq scheduler process is started (look in the file where
system messages are recorded).

<P>
If you have a binary distribution for a Silicon Graphics machine,
&lt;<I>version</I>&gt; and &lt;<I>n</I>&gt;
are displayed in <TT>"versions -n hylafax.sw"</TT>;
for example:

<UL><LISTING>
I = Installed, R = Removed

   Name                 Version     Description

I  hylafax              1006004075  HylaFAX Facsimile Software, Version 3.0beta
I  hylafax.sw           1006004075  HylaFAX Software
I  hylafax.sw.client    1006004075  HylaFAX Client Software
I  hylafax.sw.server    1006004075  HylaFAX Server Software
</LISTING></UL>

Here
&lt;<I>version</I>&gt; = 3.0beta and
&lt;<I>n</I>&gt; = 075 (the right three digits in the Version
column), so this is HylaFAX v3.0beta075.

<P>
Note that HylaFAX is distributed in two versions:
a <I>released version</I> with patch levels to fix small
bugs or problems and a <I>beta version</I>.
Released versions represent software that has been carefully tested on
all supported platforms and is believed to compile, install, and
function correctly (except where noted in the documentation).
Released versions take a long time to create. The last
few released versions have been at least 12 months apart.
Beta versions are test versions of the software that are distributed
more frequently than released versions.
These versions include new
facilities and/or support for new systems. 
They are typically tested
on one or two systems, but not as thoroughly as released versions and
not on all supported systems.
The current released and beta versions can always be found
on the HylaFAX home page.
