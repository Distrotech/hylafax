<P>
<EM>Most of the problems/issues listed here are fixed
in the rev 6.13 firmware.</EM>

<UL>
<LI><TT>AT+FMDL?</TT>
and
<TT>AT+FREV?</TT>
return the same string, the concatentation of
  the modem model and the firmware revision.
<LI>Some prom revisions do not include a trailing "<TT>OK</TT>" in response to
<TT>AT+FDCC=?</TT>
<LI>DC2 must be sent to the modem to trigger the transfer of Phase C
  data from the modem to the host after a <TT>AT+FDR</TT> command; this reflects
  revision 2388-B of the Class 2 spec and is different from the DC1
  required by 2388-A (and accepted by most modems)
<LI>The modem advertises that it supports the 2DMR data format, but it
  does not; this "advertisement" is both in its result string for a
<TT>AT+FDCC=?</TT> query and in the DIS/DCS sent to clients
<LI>Sending 2DMR data to the modem can cause it to lock up leaving CTS
  low to the host; some versions of firmware also send an infinite
  stream of trash to the remote side when this condition occurs
<LI>In some prom revisions the result string from a
<TT>AT+FDCC=?</TT> query does
  not conform to any syntax listed in either 2388-B or 2388-A;
  furthermore, it requires a context sensitive parser!
<LI><TT>AT+FDIS</TT>
commands to set session parameters after establishing a
  connection with a remote machine are accepted but ignored; this
  makes it impossible to select/change data format (1D vs 2D encoding)
  and vertical resolution (98lpi vs 196lpi); since it is not in general
  feasible to set all session parameters before dialing the telephone,
  this problem makes it possible only to support the minimum set of
  Group 3 capabilities (1D data, 98 lpi)
<LI>Sending non-Class 2 commands to the modem after establishing a
  connection often causes the modem to drop carrier; for example,
  <TT>ATM0</TT> before a <TT>AT+FDR</TT> command will do this;
<LI>The line counts in the <TT>+FPTS</TT> result code during a reception are
  total nonsense; the only way to deduce the number of lines in a
  received page of data is to parse the data on the host
<LI>In later versions (5.05 for example) the syntax of the <TT>+FPTS:</TT>
  result code violates 2388-A and/or 2388-B
<LI>There is no way to abort a session (i.e. the <TT>AT+FK</TT> command is not
  recognized)
<LI>When sending, the modem appears to immediately drop DCD when it
  loses carrier; this usually occurs after a final
<TT>AT+FPTS</TT>
is sent
  to the host, but before the requisite OK and and/or +FHNG strings;
  this action appears to be independent of whether or not DCD is
  configured to follow carrier (i.e. <TT>&C0</TT> or <TT>&C1</TT>)
<LI>When receiving with a negotiated 14400 signalling rate, the
<TT>+FDCS:</TT>
  status string indicates a 9600 baud signalling rate (br=3)
<LI>The reception of multiple documents appears to cause the modem to
  hangup (i.e. an EOM post page message causes the modem to hangup)
<LI>The modem sometimes sends received data to the host with the
  wrong bit order
<LI>The scheme used to do adaptive-answer asserts a data carrier before
  falling back to a fax carrier;  this can confuse a few fax modems and
  make it impossible to receive facsimile without disabling adaptive
  answer (<TT>AT+FAA=0</TT>)
<LI><TT>AT+FLID?</TT> returns
"<TT>OK</TT>" but not the current value of the local identifier.
<LI>The modem sends the host ^S/^Q during page data transmission (<TT>AT+FDT</TT>)
  even when RTS/CTS flow control is enabled

<LI>When transmitting, it is not necessary to send RTC, the
modem will append RTC to the page data upon receiving the
post-page message from the host.
