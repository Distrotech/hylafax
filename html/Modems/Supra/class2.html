<H2>SUPRA's DISCLAIMER:</H2>

   The following information has been taken from Rockwell's RC144AC 
manual. It has not been taken from the CCITT Class 2 documentation, 
which is copyrighted by the CCITT.  This information is provided for 
educational purposes only.  To fully understand this information 
requires a through knowledge of the T.4 fax image and the T.30 fax 
session protocol standards.  Due to the nature of this information, 
Supra's engineers and technical support can not and will not provide any 
help or support on this information.  While a majority of this 
information is correct, neither Supra nor Rockwell implies or warranties 
that the SupraFaxModem will work exactly as documented here. This 
information is based on an early draft of Class 2, which has undergone 
further revisions and changes by the CCITT TR29.2 committee.  We 
STRONGLY urge anyone attempting to develop fax software to get the 
required documentation from Global Engineering or the TIA.
<P>

<H2>SHORT HISTORY OF CLASS 1 AND 2</H2>

  In 1988 the CCITT TR29.2 committee accepted the Class 1 standard for 
communication between fax software and fax modems.  The committee also 
voted on, but did not accept for various technical reasons, the Class 2 
standard.  A year later, they had slightly revised the standard but 
again did not accept it.  Software and hardware manufactures decided to 
unofficially adopt this standard until the TR29.2 committee could 
develop an acceptable standard.  Since so many companies have used the 
unoffical standard, the TR29.2 committee has designated that when the 
standard is offically adopted it will be known as Class 2.0.  Over the 
last year or so, the TR29.2 committee has voted on several revisions to 
the Class 2 standard.  Their last vote was early May '92.  A no vote for 
technical reasons was entered.  The TR29.2 committee is now reviewing 
the technical issues that were raised.  At this time, Supra has not 
heard of a projected date for the next ballot.
<P>

<H2>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASS 1 AND 2</H2>

  Class 1 fax software handles all of the T.4 fax image and T.30 session 
protocol information and timming.  Thus, the ability to communicate 
properly with various fax machines is more a function of the software 
than the fax modem.  Class 2 fax software generates a T.4  fax page 
image and sends it to the fax modem a page at a time.  The fax modem 
then handles the T.30 session protocol information and timming.  This 
relieves the computer's cpu from some work.  The ability to communicate 
properly with various fax machines is more a function of the fax modem 
than the software.  However, to further complicate matters, class 2 fax 
software can issue Class 1 commands and take over some of the duties of 
the Class 2 fax modem.  
<P>

  When customers have a problem communicating correctly with a fax 
machine/modem, it can be very difficult to determine which is at fault,
 the software or the hardware.  Supra has collected numerous Class 1 and 
2 fax software for a variety of different computers.  When we receive a 
report of a problem, we use these programs to determine if it is a 
software or hardware problem.  If it is a hardware problem, we notify 
Rockwell, otherwise we notify the software company.
<P>

<H2>BUG REPORTS</H2>

  Supra is dedicated to making the best product for the best price.  If 
you feel that you have found a bug, please fax or send a letter to the 
attention of:
<PRE>
   SUPRA V32/BIS FAX BUG
</PRE>
Please fully describe the 'bug' (specific steps to generate it, phone 
numbers to call, make and model of fax/modem, rev of our ROM (from I3 
command) ), why you believe that it is a bug, what specific section of 
Class 2 applies to this bug and how you would like the bug to be fixed.  
Please remember that there are issues that have not been addressed or 
settled by the TR29.2 committee in the Class 2 specifications. (i.e. how 
the DCD and DTR lines are handled while in fax mode.)
<P>

<H2>WHERE TO GET OFFICIAL FAX DOCUMENTATION</H2>

<PRE>
  Telecommunications Industry Association
  1722 Eye St. NW
  Suite 440
  Washington, DC  20006
</PRE>

You need to ask for:

<DL>
<DD>Class 1 documentation - EIA/TIA-578
<DD>Class 2 documentation - Electronic Industries Association and 
Telecommunications Industry Association TIA Project Number 2388, 
Asynchronous Facsimile DCE Control Standard, Service Class 2, TR-29.2 
Committee Letter Ballot
</DL>

<PRE>
  Global Engineering Documents                     
  2805 McGaw Ave
  Irvin, CA  92713 
  800-854-7179
  714-261-1455
  714-261-7892 (Fax)     
</PRE>

You need to ask for:
<DL>
<DD>EIA/TIA-578 - Class 1 documentation
<DD>EIA/TIA-592 - Class 2 documentation
<DD>CCITT v7.3  - T.1 - T.90 standards, includes T.4 & T.30
</DL>

(The cost for the above docs will run close to $200.  But Global will 
also update you on any changes or additions to those standards you 
purchase.)
<P>

Global Engineering will not have the Class 2 documentation until approx. 
a month after the TR29.2 committee accepts it.  Most of those companies 
which have developed Class 2 fax software either sit on the TR29.2 
committee or know someone who does.  It may be possible to receive the 
documentation from the TIA if you present a credible proposal.  Supra 
has no knowledge of what this proposal should consist of or who you need 
to talk to.
<P>

<A HREF="class1.html">CLASS 1 FAX COMMANDS FOR SUPRA FAXMODEMS</A>
which is available on Supra BBS.
<P>

<H2>7.1  COMMAND SYNTAX AND GUIDELINES</H2>

<H3>7.1.1 DTE COMMANDS</H3>

The ISO 646 character set (T.50 International Alphabet 5, American 
Standard Code for Information Interchange) is used for the issuance of 
commands and responses.  Only the low-order 7 bits of each character are 
used for commands or parameters; the high order bit is ignored.  Upper 
case characters are equivalent to lower case characters.
<P>

For Phase C data transmission or reception, all 8 bits are needed.
<P>

<H4>DTE COMMAND LINES</H4>

A command line is a string of characters sent from a DTE to the DCE 
while the DCE is in a command state.  Command lines have a prefix, a 
body, and a terminator.  The prefix consists of the ASCII characters 
'AT' (065, 084) or 'at' (097, 116).  The body is a string of commands 
restricted to printable ASCII characters, (032-126).  Space characters 
(ASCII 032) and control characters other than CR (013) and BS (010) in 
the command string are ignored.  The default terminator is the ASCII 
&lt;CR&gt; character.  Characters that precede the AT prefix are ignored.
<P>

<H4>BASIC COMMAND SYNTAX</H4>

Characters within the command line are parsed as commands with 
associated parameter values.  The basic commands consist of single ASCII 
characters, or single characters preceded by a prefix character (e.g., 
'&'), followed by a decimal parameter.
<P>

Missing decimal parameters are evaluated as 0.
<P>

<H4>EXTENDED COMMAND SYNTAX</H4>

The facsimile commands use extended syntax.  They are preceded by the 
'+F' characters, and they are terminated by the semicolon ';' character 
(059) or by the &lt;CR&gt; that terminated the command line.
<PRE>
         AT+FAA=0         ;+FCR 1 &lt;CR&gt;
</PRE>
This command instructs the DCE to answer automatically a data or fax 
call and also enables reception.
<PRE>
         AT+FCLASS=0 &lt;CR&gt;      for data mode
         AT+FCLASS=1 &lt;CR&gt;      for Service Class 1 Fax
         AT+FCLASS=2 &lt;CR&gt;      for Service Class 2 Fax
</PRE>
In Class 2, the DCE makes and terminates calls, manages the 
communication session and negotiates (T.30 protocol) and transports the 
image date to DTE.  The T.4 protocol management of image data, etc. is 
done by DTE.
<P>

The response to 
<PRE>       AT+FCLASS=0&lt;CR&gt;       in Data Mode</PRE>
or
<PRE>       AT+FCLASS=2&lt;CR&gt;       in Service Class 2 Fax</PRE>
is
<PRE>       OK</PRE>

The service class may be set by the DTE from the choices available using 
the '+FCLASS=<VALUE>' command.
<P>

<H4>GENERAL RULES</H4>

<OL>
<LI>  +Fnnn commands must be entered completely otherwise an 
    ERROR response is sent.

<LI>  All response messages are preceded and followed by &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. 
    Multiple response commands, e.g., +FDIS:+FCSI: and +FDCS, will 
    therefore appear to a have a blank line between them.

<LI>  Fax Class 2 commands can be separated by the ";" character.  The ";" 
    can be omitted if desired.  Note that non-data commands cannot be 
    separated by ";" which is allowed as a dial modifier.

<LI>  All class 2 commands are assumed to be the final command on a 
    command line.  Additional characters will be ignored.

<LI>  An ERROR message will be generated if any of the following 
    conditions:
    <DD>a.  A class 1 command is received while in Class 2.
    <DD>b.  A Class 2 command is received while in Class 1.
    <DD>c.  A Class 1 or Class 2 action command is received while in data 
          odem mode
    <DD>d.  A Class 2 read-only parameter is given the "=" form of a +F 
          command (e.g., AT+FAXERR=5).
    <DD>e.  A class 2 action command is given the inappropriate "=" or 
          "=?" (e.g., AT+FDR=?).
</OL>

<H3>7.1.2 SERIAL PORT SPEED AND FLOW CONTROL</H3>

During fax mode, the DTE-DCE port speed is 19200 bps.
<P>

The DCE provides a speed buffer of 1024 bytes and provides DC1/DC3 
(XON/XOFF) or RTS/CTS method of controlling the data into the buffer.  
This flow control is controlled by AT&K3 or AT&K4 command.
<P>

This method of data flow control is available only for DTE to DCE 
direction of data.  There is no provision for data flow control from DCE 
to DTE.
<P>

<H4>DATA STREAM TERMINATION</H4>

The DCE exchanges streams of data with the DTE while executing data 
transfer commands.  These use data stream termination described in 
Section 3.2/ISO 2111.
<P>

The ASCII &lt;DLE&gt; character (016) is used as a special character to shield 
special characters.  The &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; character pair (<106><003>) is used 
to mark the end of a stream.  The following patterns are used:
<PRE>
   any data....&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;       end of stream
   any data....&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;DLE&gt;       single &lt;DLE&gt; in data
   any data....&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;<I>any byte</I>&gt;  delete &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;<I>any byte</I>&gt;
</PRE>

<H4>DTE to DCE STREAMS</H4>

The DCE filters the data stream from the DTE, and removes all character 
pairs beginning with &lt;DLE&gt;.  The DCE recognizes &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; as the stream 
terminator.  The DCE recognizes &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;DLE&gt; and reinserts a single &lt;DLE&gt; 
in its place.
<P>

The DTE must filter stream data to the DCE, and insert extra &lt;DLE&gt; 
characters ahead of data.
<P>

<H4>DCE TO DTE STREAMS</H4>

The DTE must filter the data stream from the DCE, and remove all 
character pairs beginning with &lt;DLE&gt;.  The DTE must recognize &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; 
as the stream terminator.  The DTE must recognize &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;DLE&gt; and 
reinsert a single &lt;DLE&gt; in its place.
<P>

The DCE filters stream data to the DTE, and inserts extra &lt;DLE&gt; 
characters ahead of data.
<P>

<H3>7.1.3  AUTO ANSWER</H3>

The DCE can answer as a data DCE or as a fax DCE.  It can answer the 
call adaptively, i.e. it can determine whether call is 'data' or 'fax'.  
The +FAA parameter controls this feature.
<PRE>
     AT+FAA=1           ; Auto answer as a facsimile or a
                        ; data modem depending on call

     CONNECT xxx        ; DCE status response if data call

     +FCON              ; DCE status response if fax call
</PRE>

<H3>7.1.4  IDENTIFICATION OF T.30 OPTIONS</H3>

Group 3 devices negotiate session parameters in DIS, DCS and DTC frames. 
 These parameters are defined in table 8.2.
<P>

<H3>7.1.5  SESSION STATUS REPORTING</H3>

The DCE provides reports to the DTE on the status of a session.  The DCE 
provides following status reports:

<OL>
<LI>  Connection and hang up status:
<PRE>
        +FCON

        +FHNG:&lt;0-255&gt;
</PRE>
<LI>  Requested DIS session parameters +FDIS:<string> reports remote 
    facsimile capabilities.
<PRE>
        Syntax:+FDIS:VR, BR, WD, LN, DF, EC, BF, ST
</PRE>
<LI>  +FDCS:&lt;<I>string</I>&gt; reports the negotiated parameters

<LI>  Phase C prompts:
<PRE>
        XON, XOFF, DC2
</PRE>
<LI>  Phase C base status reports: depending upon copy quality and related 
    end-of page status:
<PRE>
        +FPTS:&lt;1-5&gt;
</PRE>
</OL>

<H3>7.1.6  PROCEDURE INTERRRUPT NEGOTIATION</H3>

CCITT allows a station to request a procedure interruption at the end of 
a page.  This request is passed between stations by the PIP, PIN, and 
PRI-Q messages.

</PRE>


<H2>7.2 SERVICE CLASS 2 IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION</H2>

The fax class 2 commands are summarized in <A HREF="#Table7-1">Table 7-1</A>.
<P>

Three commands report identification and selection information.  Each of 
these three commands cause the DCE to send a message to the DTE.  Each 
message is 20 bytes (ASCII encoded) followed by the terminating 
character (binary 0).
<P>

<H3>7.2.1 +FMFR?, REQUEST MANUFACTURER IDENTIFICAITION</H3>

The +FMFR? command caused the DCE to send a message identifying the DCE 
product manufacturer.  The default message is:
<PRE>
    ROCKWELL
    OK
</PRE>

<H3>7.2.2  +FMDL?, IDENTIFY PRODUCT MODEL</H3>

The +FMDL? command causes the DCE to send a message identifying the DCE 
product model.  The default message is:
<PRE>
   V.32AC
   OK
</PRE>

<H3>7.2.3  +FREV?, IDENTIFY PRODUCT REVISION</H3>

The +FREV? command causes the DCE to send a message identifying the DCE 
product model revision number.  The typical default message is:
<PRE>
    V0.200 TR14-JXXX-001
    OK
</PRE>

<H2>7.3  SERVICE CLASS 2 ACTION COMMANDS</H2>

These commands transfer data, and punctuate sessions.  They also release 
specific T.30 messages.  All action commands must be the last command on 
a command line.  This is indicated by the terminating &lt;CR&gt;.
<P>

All action commands initiate processes.  The modem will not accept other 
commands from the DTE until the modem issues a final result code  (e.g. 
OK, CONNECT).  The modem will abort the process if it receives any 
character before the final result code is issued.
<P>

<H3>7.3.1  ATD, ORIGINATE A CALL</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:    ATD...&lt;CR&gt;
</PRE>

The DCE can support a DTE command to originate a call using the ATD 
command (See Table 4-2).
<P>

If this command is unsuccessful, the DCE reports an appropriate failure 
or error type result code such as NO CARRIER, NO DIALTONE or BUSY (see 
Table 4-7).
<P>

If this call is successful, the typical DCE response is:
<PRE>
   ATDnn.nn         (go off-hook, dial, get CED)
   +FCON            (DCE detects flags)
   [+FCSI:&lt;remote ID string&gt;]
   +FDCS:&lt;T.30 subparameter string&gt;
   OK
</PRE>

The DCE dials, detects call progress and generates the CNG tone.  Then 
it waits for a DIS frame.  On detection of the first Phase B preamble 
(V.21 ch. 2 modulated by 300 bit/s HDLC flags) it reports the "+FCON" 
message to the DTE.  The DCE then switches to 19.2K bps.
<P>

The DCE generates a DCS frame based on the received DIS frame and on the 
previously set +FDIS parameter.  A +FDT command from the DTE releases 
the DCE to transmit that DCS frame.
<P>

The DCE reports the initial received T.30 negotiation messages, 
including the DIS frame and the optional CSI ID string.  The +FDIS: 
report is followed by the OK final result code.
<P>

<H3>7.3.2  ATA, ANSWER A CALL</H3>

The DCE can support a DTE command to answer an incoming call using the 
ATA command (see Table 4-2).
<P>

The DTE may issue an Answer command in response to an incoming ring.
<P>

If the Answer command is unsuccessful, the DCE will report an 
appropriate failure or error type result code, such as NO CARRIER (see 
4-7)
<P>

<H4>MANUAL CALL ANSWER</H4>

If this call is successful, the typical DCE response (answer and 
receive) is:
<PRE>
  +FCON
  [+FTSI:&lt;remote ID string&gt;]
  +FDCS: &lt;T.30 subparameter string&gt;
  OK
  (DTE should issue +FDR command here)
</PRE>

On receipt of an Answer command from the DTE, the DCE answer and 
generates the CED tone.  The DCE then generates a DIS frame (derived 
from the +FDIS parameter) and hunts for the first T.30 negotiation 
frames.  On detection of the first Phase B preamble (V.21 ch 2 modulated 
by 300 bit/s HDLC flags), it reports the "+FCON" message to the DTE.
<P>

The DTE should report the initial received T.30 negotiation messages, 
including the DCS frame.  The +FCS: report will be followed by the OK 
final result code.
<P>

<H4>AUTOMATIC ANSWER</H4>

The modem provides for automatic answering of incoming calls.  If 
configured for automatic answer, the modem answers and incoming call in 
compliance with T.30 and reports the same messages as described for 
manual answer.
<P>

<H4>CONNECTIONS AS A DATA MODEM</H4>

If configured to do so by the +FAA parameter, the DCE will adaptively 
answer as a facsimile DCE or as a data DCE.  If the DCE answers as a 
facsimile DCE or as a data DCE.  If the DCE answers as a data DCE, it 
resets the +FCLASS parameter to 0 and issues the appropriate final 
result code (e.g. CONNECT or NO CARRIER) to the DTE.
<P>

<H3>7.3.3  +FDT, DATA TRANSMISSION</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax: +FDT&lt;CR&gt;
</PRE>

The +FDT command prefixes Phase C data transmission.  When the DCE is 
ready to accept Phase C data, it issues the negotiation responses and 
the CONNECT result code to the DTE.
<P>

In Phase B, the +FDT command releases the DCE to proceed with 
negotiation, and releases the DCS message to the remote station.  In 
Phase C, the +FDT command resumes transmission after the end of a prior 
transmit data stream.
<P>

<H4>INITIATE PAGE TRANSMISSION</H4>

Phase B DCE polled response:
<PRE>
  [+FCSI:&lt;remote ID string&gt;]                   ; If new CSI received
  [+FDIS:&lt;subparameters from remote station&gt;]  ; If new DIS received
  +FDCS:&lt;T.30 subparameter string&gt;
  CONNECT
  &lt;XON&gt;                                        ; When ready for data
</PRE>

After placing a call, or after finishing a document exchange, the DTE 
may command the DCE to re-enter T.30 Phase B to attempt to negotiate a 
document transmission.
<P>

<H4>CONTINUE A PAGE</H4>
<PRE>
   CONNECT
   &lt;XON&gt;
</PRE>

The DTE may issue more than one +FDT command for a given page, so that 
different files may be concatenated together.  These files must have the 
same format.
<P>

<H4>PHASE C DATA FRAMING</H4>

Phase C data must be presented to the DCE in stream mode.  The DCE 
expects Phase C data to follow until it detects &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; termination 
characters.  The DCE will filter the stream as described in Section 
7.1.2
<P>

The DCE will acknowledge the end of the data by returning the OK result 
code to the DTE.
<P>

If there is data underrun before the next +FDT or +FET= command, the DCE 
will zero-fill pad as per T.4 until the  Phase C timeout (+FPHCTO) is 
reached, or until more data is received.  The DCE appends an RTC pattern 
to the transmit data after an +FET= command is received from the DTE.
<P>

<H4>PHASE C DATA FORMAT</H4>

The Phase C data will be of the format specified by the negotiated T.30 
DCS frame.  The +FDCS <string> response is defined in section 7.4.2.  
The subparameter values are described in table 7.2.
<P>

The DCE will use the negotiated minimum Scan Time parameter from the DCS 
frame , and insert sufficient fill bits to pad each line to the minimum 
scan time.  This is reported in the +FDCS:ST subparameter.
<P>

If the DCE finds more than one consecutive EOL in Phase C data (e.g. 
RTC), it will send only one EOL.
<P>

Note 1:  Phase C data must conform to T.4 specifications
<P>

Note 2:  The DTE need not include a final RTC, since the DCE will append 
         an RTC in response to an FET= command
<P>

Note 3:  Some facsimile machines may treat two EOLs as an RTC
<P>

<H4><CAN>, ESCAPE FROM TRANSMISSION</H4>

The DCE may request the DTE to halt Phase C transmission, by sending an 
cancel <CAN> character (024) to the DTE.  In this case, the DTE should 
terminate Phase C transmission, issue <CAN>, and wait for the OK 
response code from the DCE.
<P>

<H3>7.3.4  +FET=, TRANSMIT PAGE PUNCTUATION</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:   +FET=&lt;ppm&gt;[,&lt;pc&gt;,&lt;bc&gt;,&lt;fc&gt;]

DCE response:
  +FPTS:&lt;ppr&gt;    ; when receive from remote OK
</PRE>

This command is used to punctuate page and document transmission after 
one or more +FDT commands.  This command generates T.30 Post Page 
Messages selected by the &lt;ppm&gt; code (<A HREF="#Table7-3">Table 7-3</A>)
<P>

The +FET=&lt;ppm&gt; command indicates that the current page is complete; no 
more data will be appended to it.  The value indicates if there are any 
additional pages are to be sent and, if so, whether there is a change in 
any of the document parameters.
<P>

The DTE can command the DCE to generate PRI-Q messages with the 
+FET=&lt;ppm&gt; command using ppm codes 4-6 (see <A HREF="#Table7-3">Table 7-3</A>)
<P>

This command must be sent within the time out specified by +FPHCTO after 
sending Phase C data, or else the DCE will end the page and document 
transmission.  If the Phase C timeout is reached, the DCE sends an EOP 
post page message and terminates the session
<P>

The remote facsimile station should respond to the post page message 
with a post page response.  The DCE will report this using the 
+FPTS:&lt;ppr&gt; response (<A HREF="#Table7-4">Table 7-4</A>)
<P>

<H4>END A PAGE</H4>

The +FET= command causes the DCE to append an ETC (6 EOL) pattern as 
needed and enter Phase D by sending the selected T.30 Post Page message.
<P>

The +FET=1 (EOM) command signals the remote station that the next 
document will have a new DCS negotiated; this causes the session to re-
enter Phase B.
<P>

<H3>7.3.5  +FDR, BEGIN OR CONTINUE PHASE C RECEIVE DATA</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:   +FDR&lt;CR&gt;

Default value:  3 seconds in some places
</PRE>

The +FDR command initiates transition to Phase C data reception.  This 
can occur after answering, dialing, a document is received, or a page is 
received.
<P>

The DCE reports the negotiated T.30 parameters, with the remote ID 
information if available.  When the DCE is ready to commence data 
transfer, it issues a CONNECT response code.  If the DCE cannot resume 
data transfer because there is no more data, it responds OK.  When the 
DTE is ready to accept data, it issues an &lt;DC2&gt; character (018) to the 
DCE.
<P>

If the DTE issues an &lt;XOFF&gt; character to the DCE for flow control, the 
DCE signals the DTE when its buffers are empty by sending a &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;DC2&gt; 
(&lt;016&gt;&lt;018&gt;) character pair.
<P>

When the DCE delivers that last byte of a page, the DCE reports the Page 
Transfer Status via the +FPTS:&lt;ppr&gt; response
(<A HREF="#Table7-4">Table 7-4</A>).
<P>

After a Page Transfer Status Report, the DCE reports the post page 
message from the remote facsimile station via the +FET:&lt;ppm&gt; response 
(<A HREF="#Table7-3">Table 7-3</A>)
which signals the intentions of the remote station.
<P>

</PRE>

The DCE holds the post page response message to the remote facsimile 
station (MCF, etc.), represented in the +FPTS parameter until the next 
+FDR command.  The DTE may modify the +FPTS parameter before issuing the 
+FDR command which releases that message.  The DTE must issue a +FDR 
command to release Post Page Messages.
<P>

<H4>INITIATE DOCUMENT RECEPTION</H4>

The +FDR command may be issued in Phase B after an answer command, or in 
Phase B after a pervious document.
<P>

The DCE response in stream mode is:
<PRE>
   +FCR             ; when CFR sent
   [+FTSI:&lt;remote ID string&gt;]  ; if new TSI received
   +FDCS:&lt;T.30 subparameter string&gt;]  ; if new DCS

   +FET:&lt;ppm&gt;
   OK
   (DTE must issue +FDR command to release post page response)
</PRE>

<H4>CONTINUE DOCUMENT RECEPTION</H4>

The DTE may issue a +FDR command in Phase D, which releases the post 
page message, and indicates readiness to receive another page after 
receipt of a Multipage (+FET:0) or PPS-NULL (+FET:3) message.  The DCE 
response will be:
<PRE>
   CONNECT
   (&lt;DC2&gt; needed from DTE here)
   &lt;Phase C data stream&gt;
   &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;
   +FPTS:&lt;ppr>,&lt;lc&gt;[,&lt;blc&gt;,&lt;cblc&gt;]
   +FET:&lt;ppm&gt;
   OK
   (DTE must issue +FDR command to release post page response.
</PRE>

If done receiving:
<PRE>
   +FHNG:&lt;hangup cause code&gt;
   OK

   Continue page reception
</PRE>

<H4>PHASE C DATA FRAMING</H4>

Phase C data may be presented to the DTE in stream mode.  The DCE will 
transfer a stream of data to the DTE, followed by the &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; stream 
termination characters.  The DCE will filter the stream as described in 
7.1.2.
<P>

<H4>PHASE C DATA FORMAT</H4>

The received data format is negotiated under T.30 reported by the 
+FDCS:VR,BR,WD,LN,DF,EC,BF,ST response.
<P>

The DCE will delete the terminating RTC (6 EOLs) patterns.  The DCE may 
strip zero fill bits from the data, to minimize storage needs.
<P>

<H4><CAN>, ESCAPE FROM RECEPTION</H4>

From the +FDR command until the end of Phase D Date, the DCE is in a 
data transfer state, and will not respond to DTE command characters.  
The DCE will respond to three ASCII control characters, &lt;DC1&gt; (017) and 
&lt;DC3&gt; (019) flow control characters, and cancel &lt;CAN&gt; (024).
<P>

Upon receipt of the &lt;CAN&gt; character, the DCE will terminate the 
reporting of received data by sending trailing &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; characters to 
the DTE, and will then execute an implied +FK command in order to 
conduct an orderly disconnection.
<P>

<H3>7.3.6  +FK, SESSION TERMINATION</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:  +FK
</PRE>

The +FK command causes the DCE to terminate the session in an orderly 
manner.  In particular, the DCE will send a DCN message at the next 
opportunity and hang up.  At the end of the termination process, the DCE 
will report the +FHNG response with result code
(A HREF="#Table7-5">Table 7-5</A>).
<P>

This operation can be invoked by using the cancel &lt;CAN&gt; character during 
Phase C data reception (see prior section).
<P>

The DCE will wait until the current page completes, unless the reception 
is of unlimited length; in that case, the DCE may halt reception and 
terminate the session at any time.
<P>

<H2>7.4  SERVICE CLASS 2 DCE RESPONSES</H2>

The DCE sends information responses to the DTE as a facsimile session 
proceeds.  They indicate the state of the facsimile session and convey 
need information.  These messages are solicited messages generated in 
execution of DTE action commands described in section 7.3.
<P>

The DCE precedes and follows the following information responses with 
&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.
<P>

The DCE provides the on-line status of several session parameters when 
they are available during T.30 handshaking.  These include the remote ID 
string and the DIS/DCS parameters.  These responses report the T.30 
session parameter frames.  The subparameters are described in
<A HREF="#Table7-2">Table 7-2</A>.
<P>

<H3>7.4.1  +FCON, FACSIMILE CONNECTION RESPONSE</H3>

+FCON indicates connection with a fax machine.  It is released by 
detection of HDLC flags in the first received frame +FCON is generated 
in response to an Originate or Answer command.
<P>

<H3>7.4.2  +FDCS:, REPORT CURRENT SESSION CAPABILITIES</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:   +FDCS:VR,BR,WD,LN,DF,EC,BF,ST
</PRE>

+FDCS:&lt;string&gt; reports the negotiated parameters.  Phase C data will be 
formatted as described by the subparameters.  This message may be 
generated in execution of +FDT or +FDR commands before the CONNECT 
result code if new DCS frames are generated of received.  (See
<A HREF="#Table7-2">Table 7-2</A>.)
<P>

<H3>7.4.3  +FDIS:, REPORT REMOTE STATION CAPABILITIES</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:   +FDIS:VR,BR,WD,LN,DF,EC,BF,ST
</PRE>

+FDIS:&lt;string&gt; reports remote facsimile station capabilities and 
intentions.  The parameters are provided in ASCII notation.  (See
<A HREF="#Table7-2">Table 7-2</A>.)
<P>

This message is generated in execution of Originate, Answer, +FDT, or 
+FDR commands.
<P>

<H3>7.4.4  +FCFR, INDICATE CONFIRMATION TO RECEIVE</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:  +FCFR
</PRE>

The DCE sends a +FCFR response to the DTE upon reception of an 
acceptable TCF training burst and a valid DCS signal from the remote 
machine.  This indicates that the DCE will receive Phase C data after 
the remote station receives the local DCE's CFR message.  The +FCFR 
message is generated in execution of a +FDR command.
<P>

<H3>7.4.5  +FTSI:, REPORT THE TRANSMIT STATION ID</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:  +FTSI:"&lt;TSI ID string&gt;" Transmit Station ID
</PRE>

This response reports the received transmit station ID string, if any. 
 This message is generated in execution of Originate, Answer, +FDT, or 
+FDR commands.
<P>

<H3>7.4.6  +FCSI:, REPORT THE CALLED STATION ID</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:   +FCSI:"&lt;CSI ID string&gt;" Called Station ID
</PRE>

This response reports the received called station ID string, if any.  
This message is generated in execution of Originate, Answer, +FDT, or 
+FDA commands.
<P>

<H3>7.4.7  +FPTS:, RECEIVE PAGE TRANSFER STATUS</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:  +FPTS:&lt;ppr&gt;,&lt;lc&gt;[,&lt;blc&gt;,&lt;cblc&gt;]
</PRE>

The +FPTS:&lt;ppr&gt; is generated by the DCE at the end of Phase C data 
reception in execution of a +FDR command.
<P>

The &lt;ppr&gt; is generated by the DCE; it depends on the DCE capabilities at 
T.4 error checking.  See Table 7-4 for &lt;ppr&gt; values.
<P>

The receiving DCE will count the lines and may optionally generate bad 
line counts.  These values are:
<PRE>
    &lt;lc&gt; = line count
    &lt;blc&gt; = bad line count
    &lt;cblc&gt; = consecutive bad line count
</PRE>

A receiving DTE may inspect &lt;ppr&gt; and write a modified
value into the +FPTS parameter.
The DCE will hold the corresponding Post Page Response message
until released by a +FDR command from the DTE.
<P>

<H3>7.4.8  +FET:, POST PAGE MESSAGE RESPONSE</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:   +FET:&lt;ppm&gt;
</PRE>

The +FET:&lt;post page message&gt; response is generated by a receiving DCE 
after DCE after the end of Phase C reception on receipt of the post-page 
message from the transmitting station.  The +FET:&lt;ppm&gt; response is 
generated in execution of a +FDR command.  The &lt;ppm&gt; codes respond to 
the T.30 post page messages (<A HREF="#Table7-3">Table 7-3</A>.)
<P>

<H3>7.4.9  +FPTS:, TRANSMIT PAGE TRANSFER STATUS</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:  +FPTS:&lt;ppr&gt;
</PRE>

The +FPTS: response reports a &ltppr&gt; number representing the copy quality 
and related post page message responses received from the remote DCE.  
The set of valid &lt;ppr&gt; values are defined in
<A HREF="#Table7-4">Table 7-4</A>.
<P>

The +FPTS:&lt;ppr&gt; response is generated in execution of a +FET=&lt;ppm&gt; 
command.
<P>

<H3>7.4.10  +FHNG:, CALL TERMINATION WITH STATUS</H3>

<PRE>
Syntax:  +FHNG:&lt;hangup status code&lt;
</PRE>

+FHNG indicates that the call has been terminated.  The hangup cause is 
reported and stored in the +FAXERR parameter for later inspection.  The 
&lt;hangup status code&gt; values are described in
<A HREF="#Table7-5">Table 7-5</A>.
<P>

+FHNG:&lt;hsc&gt; is a possible intermediate result code to any DTE action 
command described in Section 7.3.  It is always followed by the OK final 
result code.
<P>

Upon termination of a call, the DCE determines the cause of termination 
and reports it as part of the FHNG:&lt;hsc&gt; response.  It also stores this 
&lt;hsc&gt; code in the +FAXERR parameter for later inspection.
<P>

The hangup values are organized according to the phases of the facsimile 
transaction as defined by T.30.  A COMREC error or RSPREC error 
indicates that one of two events occurred:

<OL>
<LI>
a DCN (disconnect) signal was received, or
<LI>
an FCS error was detected and the incoming signal 
was still present after 3 seconds.
</OL>
<P>

The table values are in decimal notation.  Leading zero characters are 
optional.

<H2>7.5  SERVICE CLASS 2 PARAMETERS</H2>

All Service Class 2 parameters can be read, written, and tested for 
range of legal values by the DCE.  The general syntax is described in 
Section 7.1.
<P>

Group 3 FAX devices negotiate session parameters in DIS, DCS, and DTC 
frames.  The following parameters are provided to condition the 
facsimile DCE for the capabilities it will offer and to report the 
session settings negotiated.
<P>

The three primary T.30 session parameters are +FDCC, +FDIS and +FDCS.  
They are compound parameters, using values listed in
<A HREF="#Table7-2">Table 7-2</A>.
<A HREF="Figure70-1">Figure 70-1</A> illustrates their relationships.
<P>

<H3>7.5.1  +FDCC, DCE CAPABILITIES PARAMETERS</H3>

<PRE>
Write Syntax:   +FDCC:VR,BR,WD,LN,DF,EC,BF,ST

Valid values    See Table 7-2

Default values  0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0  (RC96AC)
                0,5,0,2,0,0,0,0  (RC144AC)
</PRE>

+FDCC allows the DTE to sense and constrain the capabilities of the 
facsimile DCE from the choices defined in CCITT t.30 Table 2.  When 
+FDCC is modified by the DTE, the DCE copies +FDCC into +FDIS.
<P>

<H3>7.5.2  +FDIS, CURRENT SESSIONS CAPABILIIES PARAMETERS</H3>

<PRE>
Write Syntax:   +FDIS:VR,BR,WD,LN,DF,EC,BF,ST

Valid values    See Table 7-2

Default values  0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0  (RC96AC)
                0,5,0,2,0,0,0,0  (RC144AC)
</PRE>

The +FDIS parameter allows the DTE to sense and constrain the 
capabilities used for the current session.  The DCE uses +FDIS to 
generate DIS or DTC messages directly, and uses +FDIS and received DIS 
messages to generate DCS messages.
<P>

The DCE initializes the +FDIS parameter from the +FDCC parameter on 
initialization, when +FDCC is written, and at the end of a session.
<P>

<H3>7.5.4  +FLID=, LOCAL ID STRING</H3>

<PRE>
Write Syntax   +FLID="&lt;local ID string&gt;"

Valid values:   20 character ASCII string

Default value:  Empty
</PRE>

If FLID is not a null string, it generates a TSI or CSI frame.  Table 
3/T.30 includes digits 0-9, "+" and space.
<P>

If the DCE supports use of Table 3/T.30 only, the response to a +FLID=? 
command is "(20)(32, 43, 48-57)".  If the DCE supports printable ASCII,
the response is "(20)(32-127)" 
The first "(20)" represents 
string length: the second (character values) field reports supported 
string values.
<P>

Notes: 
<OL>
<LI> The string is saved in RAM.
<LI> Non-numeric characters are not filtered out.
</OL>

<H3>7.5.5  +FCR, CAPABILITY TO RECEIVE</H3>

<PRE>
Write Syntax:  +FCR=&lt;value&gt;

Valid values:  1,0

Default values 0
</PRE>

+FCR=0 indicates that the DCE will not receive message data.  This can 
be sued when the DTE has insufficient storage.  The DCE can send and can 
be polled for a file.
<P>

+FCR is sampled in CCITT T.30 Phase A and Phase D
<P>

<H3>7.5.6  +FPTS=, PAGE TRANSFER STATUS</H3>

<PRE>
Write syntax:   +FPTS=&lt;ppr&gt;

Valid Values:   1,2,3,4,5

Default value:  0
</PRE>

<H3>7.5.7  +FCQ, COPY QUALITY CHECKING</H3>

<PRE>
Write Syntax:  +FCQ=&lt;value&gt;

Valid Values:  0

Default Value: 0
</PRE>

This parameter controls Copy Quality checking by a receiving facsimile 
DCE.
<P>

The DCE returns +FCQ=0 which indicates the DCE does no quality checking.  
The DCE will generate Copy Quality OK (MCF) responses to complete pages, 
and set +FPTS=1.
<P>

<H3>7.5.8  +FPHCTO, DTE PHASE C RESPONSE TIME-OUT</H3>

<PRE>
Write Syntax:   +FPHCTO=&lt;value&gt;

Valid Values:   0-255, 100 millisecond units

Default Value:  30
</PRE>

The +FPHCTO command determines how long the DCE will wait for a command 
after reaching the end of data when transmitting in Phase C.  When this 
time-out is reached, the DCE assumes there are no more pages and no 
documents to send.  It then sends the T.30 EOP response to the remote 
device.
<P>

<H3>7.5.9  +FAXERR, T.30 SESSION ERROR REPORT</H3>

<PRE>
Read Syntax:   +FAXERR=&lt;table value&gt;, read only

Valid values:  0-255, see <A HREF="#Table7-5">Table 7-5</A> for meaning
</PRE>

This read-only parameter indicates the cause of the hangup. 
<A HREF="#Table7-5">Table 7-5</A>
shows the valid values for this parameter as well as the meaning of the 
each value.  +FAXERR is set by the DCE at the conclusion of a fax 
session.  The DCE resets +FAXERR to 0 at the beginning of Phase A off-
hook time.
<P>

<H3>7.5.10  +FBOR, DATA BIT ORDER</H3>

<PRE>
Write Syntax:  +FBOR=&lt;value&gt;

Valid Values:  0,1

Default value:  0
</PRE>

This parameter controls the mapping between PSTN facsimile data and the 
DTE-DCE link.  There are two choices:
<P>

DIRECT:  The first bit transferred to each byte on the DTE-DCE link is 
the first bit transferred on the PSTN data carrier.
<P>

REVERSED:  The last bit transferred of each byte on the DTE-DCE link is 
the first bit transferred on the PSTN data carrier.
<P>

There are two data types to control:
<P>

This command controls Phase C data (T.4 encoded data) transferred during 
execution of +FDT or +FDR commands.
<P>

The following two codes are supported.
<OL>
+FBOR=0  selects direct bit order for Phase C data<P>
+FBOR=1  selects reversed bit order for Phase C data<P>
</OL>

Note that this parameter does not affect the bit order of control 
characters generated by the DCE.
<P>

<H3>7.5.11  +FAA, ANSWER PARAMETER</H3>

<PRE>
Write syntax:  +FAA=&lt;value&gt;

Valid values:   0,1

Default value   0
</PRE>

<OL>
+FAA=0   constrains the DCE to answer as set by +FCLASS<P>
+FAA=1   indicates that the DCE can answer and automatically <P>
</OL>

determine whether to answer as a Class 2 facsimile DCE or as a data 
modem.  If the DCE automatically switches, if modifies FCLASS 
appropriately.
<P>

Class 2 adaptive answer is implemented as follows:
<P>

First, a data mode handshake is attempted.  If the DCE has been 
configured for automode detection (using the A command), the DCE may try 
several protocols be terminating attempts to make a data mode 
connection.  This can take as long as 6-8 seconds.
<P>

If the data mode connection attempt fails, a facsimile Class 2 
connection is assumed.  When a connection is made, a result of the 
adaptive answer, the DCE issues the D or FAX result code before the 
CONNECT or +FCC message to inform the DTE of the connection type.  A 
making a class 2 connection, the DCE stays on-line rather than going 
into the command mode as with a Class 2 connection.
<P>

<H3>7.5.12  +FBUF?, BUFFER SIZE</H3>

<PRE>
Read syntax:   +FBUF?

DCE response syntax &lt;bs&gt;,&lt;xoft&gt;,&lt;xont&gt;,&lt;bc&gt; where:

  &lt;bs&gt; = total buffer size
  &lt;xoft&gt; = XOFF threshold
  &lt;xcont&gt; = XON threshold
  &lt;bc&gt; = current buffer byte count
</PRE>

The +FBUF parameter allows the DTE to determine the characteristics of 
the DCE's data buffer.  Data buffers are used for flow control.  Use of 
the reported values allow the DTE to transfer data without provoking 
XOFF.
<P>

<H2>7.6  EXAMPLE SESSIONS</H2>

<A HREF="#Table7-6">Table 7-6</A> and
<A HREF="#Table7-7">7-7</A>
