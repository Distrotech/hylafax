<LI>It has been mentioned, however, that the AT command <B>&D3</B> is broken. The
    workround is to use &C4 in place of &C1.

<a href="../acknowledge.html#Revision">Glenn Burkhardt</a>, with help from 
 Multitech support, passed on the following advice to improve the ZDX 2834's
 ability to receive faxes. .
<LI>The receive threshold in negative decibels is determined by the <b>S38</b>
    register. Its factory default value is <i>43</i>, changing it to <i>35</i>
    makes it possible to receive faxes from our AT&T 351D fax machine (and
    probably many others)>
<LI>The command <TT>ATS38=35</TT> will change the value of the S38 register.
    To prevent the factory default value from being loaded should a <TT>AT&F</TT>
    command be issued, the command <TT>AT&F9</TT> is needed.
<LI>The following, one-time, out of the box, initialization for the modem is
    therefore recommended :
    <PRE>
               AT&F
               AT&S38=35
               AT&F9
               AT&W0
     </PRE>
<LI>The explanation they had was that when the carrier was dropped as part of
    the normal facisimile handshaking, noise on the line was above the receive
    threshold level, making the modem think that the carrier had not been 
    dropped. Eventually, the <TT>T2</TT> timer expired, and the modem reported
    <TT>+FHNG:73</TT>  (T.30 T2 timeout, expected page not received (code 73)).
    Increasing the modem's receive threshold to -35db keeps the noise level
    below the carrier, at least for my fax machine and phone lines.
