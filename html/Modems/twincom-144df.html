<UL>
<LI>Changing DCD handling can cause the modem to drop DSR; if done
  during initialization this can cause the fax server to get confused;
  be sure that the setting loaded from NVRAM on reset agrees with
  the value specified in the config file (<TT>&C1</TT> by default);
<LI>Instead of the normal <TT>&D3</TT> setup string for RC144AC-based modems,
  <TT>&D2</TT> should be used (note that this configuration must be done
  manually as faxaddmodem is incapable of distinguishing between
  RC144AC-based modems)
<LI>The line counts in the +FPTS result code during a reception are
  total nonsense; the only way to deduce the number of lines in a
  received page of data is to parse the data on the host
<LI>The modem has frequently been observed to just lockup during message
  receive (i.e. <TT>AT+FDR</TT>);
  it dropped DCD to the host but did not return
  &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; and/or a <TT>+FHNG</TT> code
<LI>In testing the modem locked up during transmission to a Multi-Tech 1432BA
modem and failed to respond to the host dropping DTR
