    do not accept more than 100 commands
<LI><B>configure</B> now records the setting of all configuration parameters
    in a <B>config.cache</B> file that is re-read at startup; this makes
    parameters set interactively persistent across configuration runs
<LI><B>configure</B> now automatically checks for the SunPRO C++ product
    as a potential compiler
<LI>the Makefile rules for the SunPRO C++ compiler are now properly
    setup on SunOS systems
<LI><B>configure</B> now verifes that the C++ facilities properly support
    global static variables with constructors (as required by the software)
<LI><B>configure</B> no longer assumes the function declaration for
    <TT>crypt</TT> resides in <B>&lt;crypt.h&gt;</B> when that file is
    present
<LI>auto-configuration of the AFM files was corrected
<LI>several new configuration parmaeters were added to control
    workarounds for systems with incorrect function declarations
<LI>DSO configuration has been changed to make it easier for non-IRIX
    schemes to be added
<LI><B>configure</B> now sets <TT>CONFIG_OPENFIFO</TT> to
    <TT>O_RDWR</TT> for recent Linux systems (to workaround a kernel
    bug introduced in release 1.3.80)
