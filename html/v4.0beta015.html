<P>
Note that this is a <STRONG>major new distribution</STRONG> and lots
of things have changed.  Consult the <A HREF="hylafax4.0.html">general overview</A>
for a high-level description of the new functionality provided in the
v4.0 software.

<P>
This document describes the changes made to the software between the
<I>previous</I> and <I>current</I> versions (see above).
If you don't find something listed here, then it was not done in this
timeframe, or it was not considered important enough to be mentioned.

<A NAME="configure"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>a bug that caused verifying the version of the configured TIFF software
    to fail on certain systems was corrected
<LI>the <TT>TIFFINC</TT> and <TT>LIBTIFF</TT> configuration parameters are
    no longer read from the <B>config.cache</B> file
<LI>the configured awk program must now support the <TT>function</TT> keyword
    instead of the <TT>func</TT> keyword
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="faxq"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES TO FAXQ:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI><B>faxq</B> now polls for the removal of UUCP lock files that are
    unexpectedly encountered when a modem is assigned to an outbound
    job; this corrects a problem for send-only environments where a
    modem used by a non-HylaFAX command would be ``lost'' by <B>faxq</B>
<LI>a bug was fixed for send-only environments that caused <B>faxq</B>
    to stop scheduling jobs when a modem that is assigned to an outbound
    job is discovered to be in-use
<LI>modems that are discovered in-use by a <B>faxgetty</B> process are
    now marked busy; this corrects a scheduling problem for servers
    with multiple modems
<LI>a bug was fixed in the <TT>Dispatcher</TT> that caused child processes
    to be ``lost'' on AIX systems 
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="faxsend"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES TO FAXSEND:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>the result string from an <TT>AT+FCLASS=?</TT> query is now more
    carefully processed; only class values in the range 0-31 are used
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="faxqclean"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES TO FAXQCLEAN:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>a bug was fixed that caused documents to be incorrectly removed as
    unreferenced when the associated job was in the <B>sendq</B> directory
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="misc"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN MISCELLANEOUS STUFF:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>the <B>faxaddmodem</B>, <B>faxsetup</B>, <B>xferstats</B>,
    <B>recvstats</B>, <B>mkcover</B>, <B>notify.awk</B>, and
    <B>faxcron</B> scripts
    were changed to use the <TT>function</TT> keyword when constructing
    awk programs
<LI><B>faxmail</B> has a new configuration parameter/meta-header that can
    be used to substitute strings in formatted mail
<LI>typos in <B>xferstats</B> were corrected that broke sorting by certain keys
</UL>
