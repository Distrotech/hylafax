<A NAME="configure"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI><B>config.guess</B> now recognizes ISC systems
<LI>a typo in <B>config.h.in</B> was corrected and by default support
    for Unix domain sockets is not configured (there is no support
    presently implemented so this change just avoids trying to compile
    some code that is not used)
<LI><B>configure</B> now checks to see if the <TT>ftruncate</TT> function 
    is present in the C library before trying to emulate it
<LI>the check for support of memory-mapped files was corrected; it had
    compiled a test application but never actually ran it
<LI>if the file <B>&lt;sys/bsdtypes.h&gt;</B> is present it is now
    automatically included in <B>port.h</B>
<LI>if the file <B>&lt;net/errno.h&gt;</B> is present it is now included
    by code that uses socket-related system calls
<LI><B>configure</B> now checks for function prototypes for socket-related
    system calls used by the software
<LI>the manual page handling now supports 4.4BSD-organized pre-formatted
    manual pages that are not compressed
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="modemconfig"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE MODEM CONFIG FILES:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>a new prototype config file <B>rockwell</B> was added to deal
    with a problem where the <B>rc144ac</B> prototype file was being
    selected for modems based on the RC288DPI
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="faxsend"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES TO FAXSEND:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>the code that writes files in the <B>info</B> directory has been rewritten
<LI>several error messages were corrected
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="hfaxd"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES TO HFAXD:</B></A>

<UL>

</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="misc"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES TO MISCELLANEOUS PROGRAMS:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>a bug was fixed that caused <B>faxaddmodem</B> and <B>probemodem</B>
    to not find an appropriate <B>echo</B> command on SunOS 4.1.4 systems
<LI>the <B>faxqclean</B> program now purges document files with a <B>cover</B>
   prefix; this fixes a problem where documents submitted by old software
   were not being purged
<LI>the <B>tiff2fax</B> script was fixed to correctly invoke <B>tiffcp</B>
   when converting submitted TIFF that require data reformatting
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="util"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE SUPPORT LIBRARY:</B></A>

<LI>various portability problems were fixed
