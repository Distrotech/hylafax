The source distribution comes in a compressed tar file.  To extract the
software do something like:

<UL><LISTING>
% zcat &lt;somewhere&gt;/v3.0beta099-tar.Z | tar xf -
</LISTING></UL>

(uncompress and extract individual files).  The
software is almost entirely written in C++. 
If you do not have a working C++
compiler and associated libraries for your machine, check
<A HREF="building.html">here for information on obtaining GNU gcc
and libg++</A>.

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="icons/warning_icon.gif" ALT="NOTE: " HSPACE=4></TD>
<TD><EM>If you plan to use GNU gcc to build the software, you must use version
2.6.1 or newer.  gcc 2.6.3 and libg++ 2.6.2 are the current recommended versions
of the GNU tools to use, though newer versions should also work</EM>.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
To build and install executables from the sources check the
the <A HREF=setup.html#Guidance>section on system-specific guidance</A>
for any known problems, then do the following:

<UL><LISTING>
% ./configure		# see <A HREF="building.html#Building">above</A>
% make
% su			# NB: installation must be done by the super-user
# make install
</LISTING></UL>

If you have problems building the software consult the
<A HREF="building.html">complete documentation on building the software</A>
and the <A HREF="http://www.vix.com/hylafax/FAQ/">HylaFAQ</A>.

<P>
To complete the installation you may need to install one or more of the
following:
<UL>
<LI> Ghostscript
or the Display PostScript-based PostScript interpreter that is supplied
in binary form for Silicon Graphics machines.
There is information on
<A HREF="ghostscript.html">
obtaining and setting up Ghostscript
</A>
and information on
<A HREF="building.html#Before.ps2fax">
obtaining the ps2fax program
</A>.
If you use Ghostscript, <EM>do not forget to get the fonts</EM>!
<LI> If you are using Ghostscript you may also need to install
Adobe Font Metric files; these should have been automatically
configured for installation if they were not found on the system
where the build took place.
</UL>

<P>
Once you have the software installed, see the chapter on
<A HREF="setup.html">
Server Setup and Basic Configuration</A> to understand how to
complete the installation procedure.
