<UL>
<LI>the IRIX binary distribution inst images were overhauled; HylaFAX

   and the sample AFM files were placed in the software image
<LI>the HTML materials were significantly revised (but are still unfinished)
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>various problems with configuring optional packages were corrected
<LI>the HTML materials are now processed by configure to fix pathnames
<LI>the DPS and Ghostscript-based RIPS are now handled separately so
   that IRIX systems can configure each independently
<LI>parameters were added for controlling the use of -lmalloc
    (<TT>LIBMALLOC</TT>) and -lsun (<TT>LIBSUN</TT>)
<LI>parameters were added for configuring the HTML materials; consult
    the <B>config.site</B> file
<LI>configure was changed to deal with the fact that various sed's
    only support 100 commands
<LI><TT>strdup</TT> is now checked for in -lg++ to deal with some Sun systems
<LI>a problem with deducing signal handler types was corrected
<LI>the default <TT>GETTY</TT> definition for Ultrix was corrected
<LI>the manual page processing was corrected for various systems
<LI>the <TT>install.sh</TT> script used to emulate the IRIX install
    program now understands that certain files should be updated only
    if they have not been changed since the last distribution; also
    a problem with stripping non-executable files has been corrected
</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="modemconfig"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE MODEM CONFIG FILES:</B></A>

<UL>
<LI>existing inetd.conf entries are now checked to make sure the pathname
   for faxd.recv corresponds to the path configured for installation
<LI>old prototype config files are ignored
<LI>the DTE-DCE line speed is checked against the speed specified by the

</UL>

<P><HR WIDTH=65% ALIGN=right>

<A NAME="utility code"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>HANGES IN THE UTILITY CODE:</B></A>

   invalid Windows-generated PostScript constructs (the patch had busted
   valid PostScript)
