It seems that ``FlexFAX''
is a registered mark in the state of New Hampshire.
This was only recently discovered after more than 5 years of use
and so a new name has been selected.

<P>
Beginning with the next distribution the UNIX-based fax software
package previously known as FlexFAX will officially be named
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>H</FONT>YLA<FONT SIZE=+1>FAX</FONT></B>.
Please note that
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>H</FONT>YLA<FONT SIZE=+1>FAX</FONT></B>
is a trademark of Silicon Graphics and its use is governed by all
the usual trademark laws.

<P>
Given the longstanding use of the name ``FlexFAX'' I do not expect
everyone to immediately start calling the software by its new name.
Officially, however, the name will change so just do not be confused
by the change in the documentation and source code!
