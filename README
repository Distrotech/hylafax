                           *   ANNOUNCE   *

The HylaFAX development team is pleased to announce our 4.3.8 release!

The 4.3 branch of HylaFAX has been in stable mode since 4.3.3.  Any
release since then is strictly a bugfix release, and as such, is a
recommended upgrade.

Our sincerest thanks go to all who participate in the development and
testing process.

                               *   *   *

This document is intended to describe the significant differences
between hylafax-4.3.3 and older releases, point out any known
incompatibilites and issues, and provide the reader with directions to
further resources regarding HylaFAX.

                       *   INCOMPATIBILITIES   *

* HylaFAX no longer uses the bin/dictionary script and etc/FaxDictionary
  file to customize emails. Users requiring customized emails should
  create etc/templates/some-directory/, copy the basic *.txt templates
  into there, set the $TEMPLATE variable in etc/FaxDispatch and
  etc/FaxNotify and start hacking. 
* QualifyCID is obsolete, having been replaced by DynamicConfig in 4.3.0
* DestControls is obsolete, having been replaced by JobControl in 4.3.0
* Some modem config files generated from earlier versions' config file
  prototypes may contain Class1TCFRecvHack.  This is no longer desireable
  for production use, and this feature should now only be used for
  debugging purposes.
* If upgrading from any release older than 4.2.2, be advised
  that CIDName/CIDNumber are now part of a larger CallID framework. 
* libtiff-3.6.1 is fatally flawed when dealing with Group 3 images.  
  Don't use it as-is.  
  See: http://bugs.hylafax.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=500

                      *   WHO SHOULD UPGRADE?   *

This release contains important fixes to the faxq job scheduler.
All users should upgrade.

Anyone presently running a version of HylaFAX older than 4.3.0 and
using DestControls should study the JobControl feature we added in
4.3.0 carefully and test migration to the new framework before
upgrading a production server. Likewise, those using QualifyCID to
reject faxes from certain callers should become familar with
DynamicConfig and RejectCall.

                     *   HYLAFAX BINARY PACKAGES   *

Binary packages for some operating systems and platforms are available.  
Please see:
