                           *   ANNOUNCE   *

The HylaFAX development team is pleased to announce our 4.3.1 release!
This release introduces a powerful new email templating system that
offers an unprecedented level of control over the branding of the
email messages HylaFAX sends, and so we encourage you to check it
out. No release would be complete without bugfixes of course, and this
one has plenty. As always, our sincerest thanks go to all who
participate in the development and testing process.

                               *   *   *

This document is intended to describe the significant differences
between hylafax-4.3.1 and older releases, point out any known
incompatibilites and issues, and provide the reader with directions to
further resources regarding HylaFAX.

                          *   NEW FEATURES   *

* Email Templating: Server administrators can now have complete
  control over the 'look and feel' of the email messages HylaFAX
  sends. We have used this only for internationalization in this
  release, but for an example of what can be done with a little
  bit of HTML, check out the hylafax-html templates at:

                         *   KNOWN ISSUES   *

** Please refer to HylaFAX Bugzilla for a detailed list of issues.

                       *   INCOMPATIBILITIES   *

* HylaFAX no longer uses the bin/dictionary script and etc/FaxDictionary
  file to customize emails. Users requiring customized emails should
  create etc/templates/some-directory/, copy the basic *.txt templates
  into there, set the $TEMPLATE variable in etc/FaxDispatch and
  etc/FaxNotify and start hacking. 
* QualifyCID is obsolete, having been replaced by DynamicConfig in 4.3.0
* DestControls is obsolete, having been replaced by JobControl in 4.3.0
* Some modem config files generated from earlier versions' config file
  prototypes may contain Class1TCFRecvHack.  This is no longer desireable
  for production use, and this feature should now only be used for
  debugging purposes.
* If upgrading from any release older than 4.2.2, be advised
  that CIDName/CIDNumber are now part of a larger CallID framework. 
* libtiff-3.6.1 is fatally flawed when dealing with Group 3 images.  
  Don't use it as-is.  
  See: http://bugs.hylafax.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=500

                      *   WHO SHOULD UPGRADE?   *

This release rolls up several months of development by the HylaFAX
community, and is a recommended release for all users. Notable changes
include fixes to improve the robustness of the Class 1 fax protocol,
the ability to resubmit failed faxes from the commandline, powerful
email templating, a new language (Romanian), stability improvements
for faxq, the ability to compile with shared libraries on Solaris, and
a long list of other fixes and tweaks too numerous to mention. If you
have done a lot of work with FaxDictionary to customize HylaFAX's
emails, then you might want to delay upgrading to 4.3.1 until you have
had a chance to study the new email templating system on a test server.

Anyone presently running a version of HylaFAX older than 4.3.0 and
using DestControls should study the JobControl feature we added in
4.3.0 carefully and test migration to the new framework before
upgrading a production server. Likewise, those using QualifyCID to
reject faxes from certain callers should become familar with
DynamicConfig and RejectCall.
