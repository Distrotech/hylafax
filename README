                           *   ANNOUNCE   *

The HylaFAX development team is pleased to announce our 4.2.4
patch level release!  As always, our sincerest thanks go to all who
participate and provide feedback.

                               *   *   *

This document is intended to describe the significant differences
between hylafax-4.2.4 and older releases, point out any known
incompatibilites and issues, and provide the reader with directions to
further resources regarding HylaFAX. 

                          *   NEW FEATURES   *

* Security fix - hfaxd vulnerability CVE-2005-3538
* Security fix - script vulnerability CVE-2005-3539 
* PAM support on Solaris
* Local/GMT timezone support in JOBFMT/RECVFMT formatters
* numerous other enhancements and bugfixes (see CHANGES)

                         *   KNOWN ISSUES   *

** Please refer to HylaFAX Bugzilla for a detailed list of issues.

                       *   INCOMPATIBILITIES   *

* Some modem config files generated from earlier versions' config file
  prototypes may contain Class1TCFRecvHack.  This is no longer desireable
  for production use, and this feature should now only be used for
  debugging purposes.
* The time value of %Z in jobfmt/recvfmt is now returned in GMT time
  when GMT is requested, and in local time when local time is
  requested. Previously, %Z was always returned in local time, even
  if GMT had been requested.
* If upgrading from any releases other than 4.2.2 or 4.2.3, be advised
  that CIDName/CIDNumber are now part of a larger CallID framework. 
* libtiff-3.6.1 is fatally flawed when dealing with Group 3 images.  
  Don't use it as-is.  
  See: http://bugs.hylafax.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=500

                      *   WHO SHOULD UPGRADE?   *

* For security reasons, everyone should consider upgrading to this 4.2.4
  release as soon as possible.

Silicon Graphics has seen fit to allow me to give this work away.  It
is free.  There is no support or guarantee of any sort as to its
operations, correctness, or whatever.  If you do anything useful with
all or parts of it you need to honor the copyright notices.   I would
also be interested in knowing about it and, hopefully, be acknowledged.

Finally, note that this software is called ``HylaFAX'', not ``Hylafax'',
``hylafax'', and certainly not ``FlexFAX'' (the old name which someone
else has a copyright on).  If you want to refer to this software use
