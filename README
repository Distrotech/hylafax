                           *   ANNOUNCE   *

The HylaFAX development team is pleased to announce our 4.1.4
patch-level release!  The release represents many hours of work and
testing by developers and contributors, and our thanks goes to all who
participate and provide feedback.

                               *   *   *

This document is intended to describe the significant differences
between hylafax-4.1.4 and older releases, point out any known
incompatibilites and issues, and provide the reader with directions to
further resources regarding HylaFAX.

                          *   NEW FEATURES   *

* sendfax warns when -d options are used poorly
* NSF recognition on sending for virtually all US, UK, and Japan codes
* DSO versioning follows HylaFAX
* additional modem support for various USR, Digi, and Lucent/Agere modems
* faxqclean now has a "force archiving" option
* faxanswer supports Caller-ID now when faxgetty is running
* removed support for Solaris DSOs and various other Solaris bugfixes
* new Class1MsgRecvHack, Class1ResponseWaitCmd, and RingExtended config
  options
* probemodem options to send one command and not kill faxgetty
* improve the select bug workaround
* faxq triggers LOCKWAIT explicitly when initiating faxsend
* faxgetty polls for lockfiles while RUNNING
* fix broken facsimile polling when in Class 1

                         *   KNOWN ISSUES   *

* HylaFAX corrupts images received in 2D-MMR (patch available).
* Specific support for fax class 1.0 is not yet implemented.
* A low-priority job can block a high priority job to the same destination.
** Please refer to HylaFAX Bugzilla for a detailed list of issues.

                       *   INCOMPATIBILITIES   *

* faxinfo from older installations of HylaFAX will not give correct 
  output when run against newly received fax image files.  faxinfo from 
  4.1.3 and later can read both newly received and older fax image files.
* HylaFAX source needs to be extracted and built on a case-sensitive
  filesystem.  Users with case-insensitive filesystems, such as those with
  Mac OS X HFS, will need to mount a new filesystem (i.e. UFS) for this
  purpose.
* The popular faxrcvd-mail scripts have been deprecated by FILETYPE use in 
  FaxDispatch, and unchanged, will not work with faxgetty in 4.1.3 and later.
  See 'man faxrcvd' for details.

                      *   WHO SHOULD UPGRADE?   *

A large number of security fixes were included in the 4.1.3 release of
HylaFAX which make it very important to upgrade to 4.1.3 or newer. If you
are not already running 4.1.3, this 4.1.4 release is a recommended
upgrade.

Anyone already running 4.1.3 on Solaris should also upgrade, since a number
of Solaris-specific issues were addressed in this release.

Users who find that their modem status does not always return to idle after
sending a fax, such as those with low-level select bugs or those running
RedHat Linux 7.3, should upgrade.
