                           *   ANNOUNCE   *

The HylaFAX development team is pleased to announce our 4.2.0
feature release!  As always, our sincerest thanks go to all who
participate and provide feedback.

                               *   *   *

This document is intended to describe the significant differences
between hylafax-4.2.0 and older releases, point out any known
incompatibilites and issues, and provide the reader with directions to
further resources regarding HylaFAX. 

                          *   NEW FEATURES   *
* added Class 1 ECM and MMR support
* added Class 1.0 V.34-Fax (SuperG3) Support
* added software-driven real-time format compression conversion
* added extended resolution support
* removed the requirement for a case-sensitive filesystem to build
* unified the queue file numbering mechanism
* integrated Caller-ID/DID support throughout the software
* numerous other enhancements and bugfixes (see CHANGES)

                         *   KNOWN ISSUES   *

* A low-priority job can block a high priority job to the same destination.
** Please refer to HylaFAX Bugzilla for a detailed list of issues.

                       *   INCOMPATIBILITIES   *

* Due to tighter adherance to ITU-T T.32 and the older Class 2 
  specifications, HylaFAX copy-quality checking and ECM support now 
  operates slightly different in Class 2/2.0/2.1 than in previous 
  versions.  This change will not effect users of most modems, but 
  because the Eicon Diva Server follows T.32 yet uses the older 
  Class 2 command interface, Diva Server users will probably need 
  to add:
    Class2ECMType:    2.0
    Class2CQQueryCmd: !3
    Class2CQCmd:      AT
  to their respective modem config files.
* libtiff-3.6.1 is fatally flawed when dealing with Group 3 images.  
  Don't use it as-is.  
  See: http://bugs.hylafax.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=500

                      *   WHO SHOULD UPGRADE?   *

This release includes nearly a year's worth of truly exceptional
contributions from HylaFAX developers and users alike, and everyone
should consider migrating to a HylaFAX-4.2.x release as soon as
possible. While every attempt has been made to retain backwards
compatibility with the 4.1.x series, it's possible that assumptions
your local installation depends upon may no longer be true. Whenever
possible, test test test before upgrading a production server!!

HylaFAX-4.2.0 will be of particular benefit to anyone running their
modems in Class 1 due to the addition of native ECM and V.34 support
(useful features that were previously available only in the
notoriously buggy Class 2 firmware of modem manufacturers).
