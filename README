                           *   ANNOUNCE   *

The HylaFAX development team is pleased to announce our 4.1.7
patch-level release!  This is a corrective release that fixes the
PageChop feature that we inadvertently broke in the 4.1.6 patch-level,
and is otherwise identical to 4.1.6.  As always, our sincerest thanks
goes to all who participate and provide feedback.

                               *   *   *

This document is intended to describe the significant differences
between hylafax-4.1.7 and older releases, point out any known
incompatibilites and issues, and provide the reader with directions to
further resources regarding HylaFAX. 

                          *   NEW FEATURES   *

* added new edit-faxcover script
* added various enhancements to faxsetup
* default libtiff v3.6 compatibility
* added NOTIFY_FAXMASTER and ENCODING parameters for FaxDispatch
* added 2D-MMR support for Class 2 modems that support it
* added RingTimeout, ModemRingResponse, CIDNumberAnswerLength, and
  CIDNameAnswerLength modem config parameters
* support for MultiTech MT5634ZDXb and MT5634ZBA-DID
* added subaddressing specification capability to sendfax
* numerous bugfixes (several significant) and build cleanups

                         *   KNOWN ISSUES   *

* Specific support for fax class 1.0 is not yet implemented.
* A low-priority job can block a high priority job to the same destination.
* Newer versions of awk produce odd xferfaxstats output (use --nomap).
** Please refer to HylaFAX Bugzilla for a detailed list of issues.

                       *   INCOMPATIBILITIES   *

* HylaFAX source needs to be extracted and built on a case-sensitive
  filesystem.  Users with case-insensitive filesystems, such as those with
  Mac OS X HFS, will need to mount a new filesystem (i.e. UFS) for this
  purpose.  A patch is available which makes this unnecessary.

                      *   WHO SHOULD UPGRADE?   *

A large number of mission-critical bugs were fixed in 4.1.6 (see
CHANGES), but the PageChop feature was broken in that release and many
chose not to upgrade.  Upgrading to 4.1.7 is now strongly recommended
for all users of 4.1.5 or older, and for anyone who installed 4.1.6
and requires PageChop functionality.  If in doubt, upgrade!

                     *   HYLAFAX BINARY PACKAGES   *
