    OF THIS SOFTWARE.


This note is basically just a placeholder.  The real documentation is
located online at the HylaFAX home page:

    http://www.hylafax.org/

The online documentation includes the full contents of the
documentation as well as an FAQ, archives of the HylaFAX/flexfax
mailing list, and associated modem-related documentation.  Preformatted
copies of this documentation and the reference manual pages is also
available by public FTP at ftp://ftp.sgi.com/sgi/fax/doc.

You will find a subset of the online documentation in the html
subdirectory.  Beware however that timely information is usually more
up to date online than in the materials in the html directory.
You can view the HTML documentation in place and/or configure it for
local installation through the configure script.


This note has the following sections:

    Installation Synopsis
    Use and Copyright
    Acknowledgements
    HylaFAX Mailing List and Other Final Words (where to send bugs)


Installation Synopsis
---------------------
Follow the directions in the online documentation.  The main material
on configuring, building, and installing the software is given in:

    http://www.hylafax.org/building.html

Server setup information is found at:

    http://www.hylafax.org/setup.html

The documentation is extensive and designed to be used when installing
the software.  There is also an FAQ that covers (or should cover)
common problems.

The basic procedure is:

    <unpack source code>
    % ./configure
    % make
    % su			# NB: must be root to setup software
    # make install
    # faxsetup

If this does not work and the problem is not clear, then you will
need to look at the documentation and/or the code.


Use and Copyright
-----------------
There is documentation!  There is GOBS of documentation.  The HTML
materials present information needed to build+setup the software; the
manual pages act as a reference guide.  There are manual pages for all
the programs and for all the files and directories that you may be
curious about.  Of course there is also source code for everything, but
this should (hopefully) not be needed.  A useful introduction to the
client applications is given in hylafax(1).  If you want to learn how
the server and spooling system work, look first at hylafax(4F).
Remember however that the manual pages are for reference; the HTML
documentation is designed to be more introductory in nature and should
usually be consulted first when you're looking for general guidance.

Please note that unless you are sending me a bug *fix* to this software
sending mail directly to me is a waste of your time.  The flexfax
mailing list (described below) is the place to send your comments and
problems.  The -request administrative alias (again, see below) is the
place to send administrative requests.

    I IGNORE ALL DIRECT MAIL REGARDING FAX SOFTWARE, FAX MODEMS, FAX
    PROTOCOLS, FAX ANYTHING, EXCEPTING MAIL THAT CONTAINS BUG FIXES.

Silicon Graphics has seen fit to allow me to give this work away.  It
is free.  There is no support or guarantee of any sort as to its
operations, correctness, or whatever.  If you do anything useful with
all or parts of it you need to honor the copyright notices.   I would
also be interested in knowing about it and, hopefully, be acknowledged.

Finally, note that this software is called ``HylaFAX'', not ``Hylafax'',
``hylafax'', and certainly not ``FlexFAX'' (the old name which someone
else has a copyright on).  If you want to refer to this software use
``HylaFAX (tm)'' and be sure to honor the Silicon Graphics trademark.

The regular expression support is based on Henry Spencer's POSIX 1003.2
compliant regex package that has ``Copyright 1992, 1993, 1994 Henry
Spencer.  All rights reserved.'' Consult regex/COPYRIGHT for the full
copyright notice associated with this software.

The zlib package used in the client-server protocol is copyright
1995-1996 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.  Consult the file
zlib/README for more information on the package.

The code to read PCF fonts is distantly related to the X11R5 code
that is ``Copyright 1990 Massachusetts Institute of Technology''; consult
faxd/PCFFont.c++ for the full copyright notice.

The textfmt program is distantly related to the lptops program written
by Nelson Beebe; there was no copyright notice on the version of the code
that textfmt grew out of.

The config.guess and config.sub scripts are part of the GNU autoconf
package and covered by the GNU Public License (GPL).  Several ideas
in the configure script are directly "borrowed" from autoconf (and I
have tried to maintain as much compatibility as possible).

HylaFAX Mailing List and Other Final Words (where to send bugs)
---------------------------------------------------------------
A mailing list for users of this software is accessible through sgi.com.
If you want to join this mailing list or have a list-related request
such as getting your name removed from it, send your request to

    flexfax-request@sgi.com

(FYI, "flexfax" is the old name for this software).  For example, to
subscribe, send the line "subscribe" in the body of your message.  The
line "help" will return a list of the commands understood by the
mailing list management software.  You can also find information on
subscribing to the mailing list at:

    http://www.hylafax.org/mailing-lists.html

Submissions to the mailing list (including bug reports) should be
directed to:

    flexfax@sgi.com

Note that the mailing list has many people on it.  Please take this
into consideration when posting notes to it; i.e. avoid posting large
trace logs and the such.  Also, when corresponding about this software
please always specify:

- what version you have (see "How to tell which version you have" above),
- what system you're running on, and,
- if the problem is modem-related, identify it and the firmware rev

For example: "HylaFAX v3.0beta99 under Solaris 2.3 with gcc 2.6.3;
ZyXEL 1496E with 6.11a firmware."

If you find the flexfax mailing list to have too much traffic for you,
there is also an announcements-only mailing list called flexfax-announce.
This can be subscribed to by sending mail flexfax-announce-request@sgi.com;
include the single line "subscribe" in the body of the message.  Note
that there is no need to subscribe to both mailing lists; postings to
the announcement list are automatically fed to the normal flexfax list.
