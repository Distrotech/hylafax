                           *   ANNOUNCE   *

The HylaFAX development team is pleased to announce our much-anticipated 
4.1 release!  The 4.1 release has been almost two years in the making, and 
is the first non-"beta" release since 4.0pl2.  The 4.1 release represents 
countless hours of work and testing by developers and contributors, and 
our thanks goes to all who participate and provide feedback.

                               *   *   *

This document is intended to describe the significant differences
between hylafax-4.1 and hylafax-4.0pl2, point out any known
incompatibilites and issues, and provide the reader with directions to
further resources regarding HylaFAX.

                          *   NEW FEATURES   *

* faxadduser and faxdeluser utilities aid in etc/hosts.hfaxd management
* greater default compatibility with more modems through prototype 
  configuration file enhancements
* BreakIntoCommentX faxcover function
* greater default compilation compatibility with various operating systems 
  and platforms
* documentation enhancements, updates, and corrections
* functionality for decoding received Non-Standard-Frames (NSF)
* compatibility with libtiff-3.5
* allow use of "none" in five config options 
* security enhancements and fixes
* faxq now load-balances modems with equal priority 
* added "Modem" option to DestControls for outbound routing
* RTNHandlingMethod, ModemDTRDropDelay, and Class1SwitchingDelay config 
  options
* numerous fixes to both Class 1 and Class 2/2.0 fax protocol
* numerous fixes and enhancments to faxsetup, faxaddmodem, and other 
  scripts
** please refer to CHANGES for a detailed list of code changes

                         *   KNOWN ISSUES   *

* MaxSendPages and JobReqOther do not work as documented or at all.
* Specific support for fax classes 1.0 and 2.1 are not yet implemented.
* The faxcover documentation discusses various "from" dictionary options 
  as well as commentX dictionary options.  Neither of these are available, 
  but there is CommentsX functionality, which is undocumented.
* Server-based fax archival support is still unimplemented (although 
  documented).
* When running in Class 2/2.0, NSF can be parsed incorrectly.
* When running in Class 1, receipt of EOM is mishandled.
* Glare is not handled (RING while initializing a modem).
* faxqclean can, under the right circumstances, delete documents which are 
  still in use.
* configure can complain about libtiff problems when the error is really 
  with zlib
** Please refer to HylaFAX Bugzilla for a detailed list of issues.

                       *   INCOMPATIBILITIES   *

* The default spool directory has changed from /var/spool/fax/ to 
  /var/spool/hylafax/  Take caution to note this change!!!  If you desire 
  to compile HylaFAX using the old spool directory:

            ./configure --with-DIR_SPOOL=/var/spool/fax

* HylaFAX 4.1 will not compile with gcc-3.0 or Mac OS-X.  Minor 
  issues still remain when compiling on Solaris or Unixware.  (Look to CVS 
  for progress on this.)
* The ModemClass config option has been completely replaced by the 
  ModemGroup option.  Functionality is identical.
* Changes to faxcover may require some changes to faxcover template files.  
  If using BreakIntoLines, the syntax has changed from:

     <comments> <line-width> <line-changing-proc> BreakIntoLines -
                                to
     <line-width> <line-height> <x> <y> <comments> BreakIntoLines -

  If the faxcover used the commentX parameters, you will need to add the 
  following function call before using the commentX parameters: 

     <maxlines> <comments> BreakIntoCommentX - 

* Other name changes have occurred:

     xferstats		--> xferfaxstats
     xferlog		--> xferfaxlog
     etc/hosts		--> etc/hosts.hfaxd
     /var/spool/fax	--> /var/spool/hylafax
     config (manpage)	--> hylafax-config
     info (manpage)	--> hylafax-info
     log (manpage)	--> hylafax-log
     shutdown (manpage)	--> hylafax-shutdown

* Font metrics are now gone.  The textfmt program can now directly read 
  Ghostscript fontmap files and thus find the corresponding afm files 
  included in the ghostscript fonts package.

                  *   HYLAFAX BINARY PACKAGES   *

Binary packages for some operating systems and platforms are available.  
Please see ftp://ftp.hylafax.org/binary/ and 
http://www.hylafax.org/howto/install.html#ss2.3.3  If you are able and 
willing to produce a binary package of HylaFAX for general distribution, 
then you are invited to join hylafax-devel@hylafax.org and solicit your 
binary package.

                          *   SUPPORT   *

to utilize the manpage documentation before turning to other support 
arenas.  However, if other support is desired, or if you would like to
