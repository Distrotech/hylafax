                           *   ANNOUNCE   *

The HylaFAX development team is pleased to announce our 4.1.3
patch-level release!  The release represents many hours of work and
testing by developers and contributors, and our thanks goes to all who
participate and provide feedback.

                               *   *   *

This document is intended to describe the significant differences
between hylafax-4.1.3 and older releases, point out any known
incompatibilites and issues, and provide the reader with directions to
further resources regarding HylaFAX.

                          *   NEW FEATURES   *

* support for MultiTech Real-Time Fax Compression Conversion via new 
  Class2RTFCC option
* support for Class 2.1 and V.34-fax (Super G3) modems
* gcc version 3 support
* new 'sendfax -z' option to read destinations from a file
* support for Solaris DSOs
* additional modem support for various MultiTech, Eicon, Sedlbauer, 
  Comtrol, and Davicom modems
* new Class2PTSQueryCmd and Class1TCFRecvHack config options
* job archival support

                         *   KNOWN ISSUES   *

* HylaFAX corrupts images received in 2D-MMR.
* Specific support for fax class 1.0 is not yet implemented.
* NSF can be parsed incorrectly if the modem doesn't report it in hex.
* sendfax use of ~/.hylarc differs from its use of hyla.conf
** Please refer to HylaFAX Bugzilla for a detailed list of issues.

                       *   INCOMPATIBILITIES   *

* faxinfo from older installations of HylaFAX will not give correct 
  output when run against newly received fax image files.  faxinfo from 
  4.1.3 can read both newly received and older fax image files.
* The popular faxrcvd-mail scripts have been deprecated by FILETYPE use in 
  FaxDispatch, and unchanged, will not work with faxgetty in 4.1.3.  See 
 'man faxrcvd' for details.

                      *   WHO SHOULD UPGRADE?   *

4.1.3 includes fixes for a remote format string vulnerability which could 
be abused in a denial of service attack.  Also fixed is a buffer 
overflow condition when receiving fax image data which potentially 
could be exploited to execute arbitrary code as root.  Also present in 
4.1.3 are fixes for several other local remote format string 
vulnerabilities which, in some installations, could lead to elevated 
privileges by abuse.  Everyone is advised to upgrade.
