                           *   ANNOUNCE   *

The HylaFAX development team is pleased to announce our 4.1.2
patch-level release!  The release represents many hours of work and
testing by developers and contributors, and our thanks goes to all who
participate and provide feedback.

                               *   *   *

This document is intended to describe the significant differences
between hylafax-4.1.2 and older releases, point out any known
incompatibilites and issues, and provide the reader with directions to
further resources regarding HylaFAX.

                          *   NEW FEATURES   *

* improved modem recognition routine (ignores firmware rev. data in ATI0)
* enhanced support for building on MacOS X and Digital Unix
* more descriptive messaging for timedout/failed jobs, and T.4 protocol errors
* enhanced support for Topic modems
* adopt safer defaults for modem rates and dial commands
* repaired an error which caused faxqclean to segfault under heavy load
* fixed a problem with faxcron which could reset sequence numbers


                         *   KNOWN ISSUES   *

* Specific support for fax classes 1.0 and 2.1 are not yet implemented.
* Server-based fax archival support is still unimplemented (although 
  documented).
* When running in Class 2/2.0, NSF can be parsed incorrectly.
* Copy quality checking by cqtest is imperfect.
* sendfax use of ~/.hylarc differs from its use of hyla.conf
* faxrm and faxalter contain format string vulnerabilities.
** Please refer to HylaFAX Bugzilla for a detailed list of issues.

                       *   INCOMPATIBILITIES   *

* The popular faxrcvd-mail scripts have been deprecated by FILETYPE use in 
  FaxDispatch, and unchanged, will not work with faxgetty in 4.1.2.  See 
 'man faxrcvd' for details.
* Failed faxes now have status "F" instead of "D".  Most client programs 
  which display/report job status will need some alteration to accomodate 
  this.
* HylaFAX 4.1.2 may not compile with gcc-3.0

                      *   WHO SHOULD UPGRADE?   *

If you've installed 4.1.1 and:

a) are not seeing faxqclean dying because of segmentation faults, and
b) don't have an unusually high rate of fax communication errors, and
c) send at least one fax per month

an upgrade is probably not essential at the present time. Users who
don't meet one of the above criteria, and users of all other versions
should upgrade as soon as practical.


                     *   HYLAFAX BINARY PACKAGES   *

Binary packages for some operating systems and platforms are available.  
Please see ftp://ftp.hylafax.org/binary/ and
